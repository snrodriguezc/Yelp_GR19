My favorite here!!  With shishito peppers on the side. The ramen is just the right portion, and as mentioned in a couple reviews the noodle to broth ratio is on point. There was also a good amount of duck, so crisp yet juicy and really flavorful. The broth is tasty, but in our style we always add in a bit of their hot sauce. Don't miss out on this!  Just enough heat and kick but it doesn't overpower the underlying goodness of the dish. The side of peppers was also a good size, and those are delicious how they are blistered, with some roasted garlic and sugar to top. \n\nSince it was national beer day (um, when isn't it??) we indulged. I had a stout on draft and my hubby had an interesting can that was from Japan yet Belgian style. It was $12!  Granted we saw that and still got it, but beware.

She started out assessing my face with make up (under a light she couldn't tell I had on foundation, powder, blush, eyeliner and mascara??) she said my skin was flawless, then removed the makeup and said she didn't want to \"force\" anything out that didn't surface with steam and cause unnecessary swelling. Sounded like a cop out for not doing extractions from the start except that's the sole reason I came in the first place. She managed to find a few spots to extract after the steam however it was extremely painful. She was not working with the skin to extract the clogged pores and impurities, she literally just jabbed my face with her tool SO hard I felt like it might break skin. The majority of my service consisted of being slathered in coconut oil (which is designed for very dry skin from what I read on the product website, I have VERY oily skin). She used it as a make up remover, ok. The cleanser, enzyme, and mask were OK, she raved about the product line and knew everything there was to know about the all natural, organic, preservative free products featured on Shark Tank. I admittedly told her I wasn't a fan of the coconut oil/ lavender (coconut smell made my stomach turn) as she started to slather it on a second time after my extractions. It didn't deter her, she proceeded to \"rub it in\" for the \"antiseptic properties after extraction\" from my boobs to my ears for another few minutes.

When you do a facial and remove makeup, you REMOVE it all.

This is a fried chicken & beer joint. Says it right in the name. Stay on course and all will be well.\n\nMy first time here, I ordered the rotisserie chicken and it didn't go so well. The portion size for the price was off and I was left feeling some sort of way. I reviewed it. The universe laughed and made it so that I worked with the Waldo's folks soon after. After seeing the hustle, love and hard work they put in to their product, I started to rethink my initial impression. After witnessing the overwhelming response to their food, I knew that there was something there. I had a good reason for not partaking of their specialties before: I have a gluten-sensitive gut. When I eat it, bad things happen. Bad things. But that's on me. It's the reason I no longer frequent breweries and bakeries. I can't have their offerings without consequence. \n\nUnwilling to explain this whole song & dance, I, instead, asked the proprietor what he would suggest as his restaurant's standard dishes. Being that we are in the age of the chicken sandwich, he suggested The OG and The Roost. Knowing there would be hell to pay (in my gut) but that I didn't have to be around people for a couple of days, I threw caution to the wind, ordered both (with sides) and drove home with my bounty to eat and watch HBO.\n\nI started with The OG. I paired this with fries and I don't know which I liked better. Waldo's does fried chicken really really well. I appreciated that it wasn't masked by a lot of random toppings, just pickle, lettuce and herb mayo. Sounds simple. Tastes incredible. I was a big fan of the fries as well: shoestring thin but loaded with flavor and there were a lot of them. Win. As much as I liked The OG, though, I liked The Roost better. Think of it as a 'younger' chicken salad sandwich. This was fire-roasted chicken, tossed in Alabama white sauce and loaded with pickles. Sounds simple. Tastes incredible. Plus, there was a LOT of chicken. As picky as I was about my initial rotisserie offering, I definitely got my money's worth with the sandwiches. The slaw that came with The Roost was a nice touch, too. I can see that being a good topping to/for The OG.\n\nI broke my own rule at Waldo's: when first trying a business, try what they do best and go from there. I, likely, won't be a regular customer due to my belly not being a good fit for what they do well but I have to say that what they do well... they do really well.

My fiance did a lot of business in Turkey so they hit it off right away. The waiter was so attentive and helpful as we were not sure what to get. \n\nYou can't just say \"I want a filet mignon medium\". That just doesn't cut it at Bern's. One must choose every detail as to even decide how thick you want the filet! I never saw anything like this!\n\nThey have a huge selection of Caviar! My Russian darling was extremely thrilled. As in America, he has NEVER seen such an assortment of Caviar on the menu from all around the world.\n\nThe food was just excellent.

There are extremely pricy bottles in there that can cost more than the average person's house in America. \n\nThey then took us to see the kitchen. My fiance said that the floor was so clean he couldn't imagine that they actually cook the food here because there was no grease on the floor. For a restaurant that's been open as along as Bern's, to keep a floor so immaculate, is almost impossible! I don't know how they managed to do it.\n\nAfter dinner, we proceeded to the dessert room which should get a review in it's own! It's very 1920's. You sit in your own little closed off booth and can choose different music to listen to. We chose jazz and my fiance ordered a armeniac from the year that he was born. He stated that it was very reasonably priced and the armeniac itself was aged to perfection. The dessert was of course extraordinary (I mean what else would you expect when you have a room specifically for dessert). Quite some time ago, the men would go to smoke cigars after dinner and the women would have dessert and gossip. They sort of held this true to this today. You don't have dessert at the table, you go to a specific room to have it. \n\nThis restaurant is truly an experience. You must reserve 3 hours to dine here if you want the full experience.

Its like how I felt when Montclaire Bowl and Shenanigan's closed. I've met so many great people, both staff, regulars and random people. Hell, even a couple exes.

In fact, I was here throughout the 2011 World Series and I celebrated the Cardinals' win with awesome people. Seen some great bands, including local greats Mo' Pleasure, Aaron Kamm and Baywolfe, as well as the popular hair metal act Zebra. Played trivia and pool, along with partying with co-workers at times. The restrooms in the back were totally gross and were always the butt of many jokes for a long time. There was never a dull moment at Laurie's Place, except times when people got shady with one another. \n\nThe food was great, as I've had several of their dishes. I'll mostly miss their Philly Steak Nachos, along with their special spicy white cheese sauce. Their burgers and fried appetizers were the bomb, especially their fries. They were always good during 50% off appetizers hours, which were usually from 7 to 10(?). The drinks were always great, even though I always criticized them for not having enough craft beer. Sometimes $1 Stags or Nattys were the cheaper way out if I wasn't going to spend very much. \n\nI've gotten to know most of the staff, but Dom was always the best bartender-and still is.

Honestly, this restaurant was a perfect place to spend my 21st birthday because it was a nice upscale restaurant with dim lighting and excellent service as well. The restaurant was not too noisy and has nice booth seating by the window. I ordered the Josephine Daiquiri, which was my first alcoholic drink ever. Personally, I thought there was a bit too much grapefruit flavoring in the cocktail, but other than that it the tequila was definitely intense and flavorful. For the small plates (appetizers) we ordered the Nashville hot scrapple and the beef tongue. I'm still not sure what the scrapple was but I can tell you that it was extremely flavorful and soft, so I highly recommend trying it if you visit. Now onto the beef tongue, I was initially a bit skeptical about trying this, but my girlfriend loves eating beef tongue so we got it anyway haha. Honestly, I was blown away by the amount of flavor that the beef tongue had, it literally just tasted like sliced meat. There was a barbeque-like taste about it that was complemented really well with the horseradish cream sauce. After a delicious round of small plates, we had our entrees, which consisted of grilled swordfish and scallops. Honestly, I think these two are the best entrees here. The grilled swordfish had a decent size portion and was cooked so that the fish was very tender and soft. The swordfish was not too salty and went well with the sauce and assorted vegetables associated with the dish. However, the scallops definitely stole the show. I think that both my girlfriend and I would agree that the scallops tasted the best. Unfortunately, the scallop entree portion only comes with 4 pieces (fancy restaurant portions), but it packs so much flavor that you want to order another portion. The corn sauce combined with the scallops made the tender scallops taste even better and further accentuated its natural flavors. I highly recommend trying the scallops because even if you don't like scallops, this dish will make you fall in love with them.

I have been to several bridal shops in the Philadelphia area and I thought Cyndi was the best by far.  She really listened to what I was looking for and made tasteful recommendations that I wouldn't have thought of myself.  Cyndi provided examples of veils and belts I could wear, but probably seeing that even choosing the dress was a big enough decision for me on that particular day, she recommended I come back to pick out the smaller details, which I really appreciated.  We also talked shop about the vendors she knew/recommended and she truly seemed to know the Philadelphia wedding scene well.  I had my mother and aunt with me during the appointment and they both complemented Cyndi.  They've been with me at other stores and they were not thrilled with some consultants we worked with so Cyndi was a welcomed sight.\n \nI specifically went to the store to see a particular dress, which was the one I ended up purchasing.  I rated the dress selection a \"3\" because although I found some beautiful gowns to try on, I felt the gown selection was not huge.  Then again, it was appropriate for that size store and perhaps adding any others out would make it seem overcrowded.  To be fair, I feel like this has been the case with many stores.  I anticipate walking in to see any model of gown I wish and that hardly turns out to be the case.  Other shops I visited: Sabrina Ann, Bijou Bridal, La Bella Moda. \n\nMy overall experience is rated a 5 because of Cyndi and because I found my wedding dress!  I will be back to revisit veil and accessory selections in the near future, plus for my gown fitting when it arrives in several months.  \n\nNote: I saw a few comments about appointment issues.  I scheduled over the phone with no issues, had my appointment confirmed via a phone call from the store two days prior, and waited about one minute before my consultant was ready to see me.

Along the wall there are bottles of wine with a spout.  You choose 1 oz, 2 oz or a full glass.  For some one who needs to count their ounces this works well.  It also allows you to try more.

Tons of reviews about lack of professionalism, poor costumer service and lack of responsiveness.  My in office visits were always fine.  Sending medication to the pharmacies seems to be a problem.  Every month they are late with sending the electronic script to my pharmacy.  Myself and my pharmacy would call them every day,  leaving multiple voicemails and would never get a response. On one occasion it took over a week, a week without my medication which left me with horrible symptoms from the withdrawal.  I was finally able to speak to office staff who kept telling me it was sent to a pharmacy I didn't use... which doesn't really do me any good.  It shouldn't take over a week to send the electronic script to the pharmacy.  \nAnother issue seems to be with the virtual sessions.  You log in to see the therapist with a link that is supposed to be sent to you; either email or text. I've only had two virtual appointments and with each one the link is never sent.  No text message,  no email in any of the email boxes. So on both occasions at the time of my appointment when I realized I wasn't getting the link I would call the office.  No answer, I have left messages with both offices, stating who I am and how many messages I have left (normally four or five). On both occasions I didn't end up hearing back from the office staff until 2hrs after my scheduled appointment asking why I missed my appointment and then confirming my email and phone number ( how many times do we need to confirm it?!? It's an electronic chart? Does someone go in and change it after the first time, or second time or third time?)It makes no sense. And yes, I can confirm that each time it is correct because suddenly staff can send the link.  \nI work in healthcare, so I try to be compassionate and understanding, but the amount of issues had and poor attitude from office staff is frustrating.

So, I will say that I have been coming here for approximately 12 years now, from being a teen to having a family and bringing my child here. Unfortunately, after the customer service that I have experienced over the past week and a half of patronizing this business, I can no longer spend my hard-earned money here. Most of my interactions have been with Hyuntae Byun, and he was very willing to give his name to address this issue, which I do appreciate. I grappled with reaching out directly to the owner or his superior since he stated that he is the assistant manager, and I was only given the info@franklinfountain email, which I'm sure he oversees. So, I decided to bring it to a public platform where my dissatisfaction can be displayed if not heard.\n\nMy Grandmother passed away in October of 2020, and I decided to stop by Franklin Fountain for nostalgic reasons because, as I've previously stated, I've been coming here for quite some years now. As a family of three, we spent around $21 per visit for ice cream this past month. I have the dates, which included 1/2,1/15, 1/19(after our anniversary dinner), and yesterday 1/22. These aren't cheap ice cream dates at all. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I usually order a pint each but never finish it, so we asked about the scoop options while Hyuntae was our cashier. My fianc\u00e9 asked for vegan Hydrox and vegan Kona macadamia and asked if the flavors could be put side by side in the containers. Hyuntae abruptly and frankly replied, \"No,\" not an explanation, just a \"No.\" Okay, well, why not? He then explained that it would be extremely difficult, which we can completely understand. We ordered, and I believe they ended up giving us all 2 scoops, which made our order around $24 + tax, but that was on me for not asking about kid sizes.  \n\nThe next time we visited, our cashier was Hyuntae again. Upon being greeted, I asked, \"Do you have kid sizes,\" now the establishment sells milkshakes, scoops, sundaes,  ice cream sandwiches, etc.. all different forms of ice cream, correct? Hyuntae replied smug and snarky, saying, \"No, we don't have kid SIZES; we have a kids size.\" Again, I brushed it off like, okay, he's just a jerk. I've dealt with people like him, and people like him are not worth an inkling of my energy. It was evident that some microaggressions were going on because we observed him being extremely jovial with the customers ahead of us.  \n\nThen we visited last night, and it was around 37 degrees outside and 2-3 hours from closing. I waited in the car, and my fianc\u00e9 went up to place our order. He was next in line, and Hyuntae decided to prioritize a phone customer over my fianc\u00e9. Customer service or great customer service would prioritize the customer in front of him and place the calling customer on hold. Now, if the customer on the phone was already on hold, you ask the customer in front of you if they mind waiting while you address the phone call. My fianc\u00e9 asked if someone else could serve him and Hyuntae said something along the lines of \"No, they're all busy\" he's the only one who can take orders at present. Then he asked my fianc\u00e9\" if he \"had a problem with that.\" Which in cold weather would cause anyone to use an explicative when you're fed up with terrible service from a repeat offender. Now, my fianc\u00e9 allegedly used the \"f-bomb.\" Hyuntae then refused his service after using the word which is fine. He didn't deserve our money. I cannot and will not accept him telling my fianc\u00e9 he refused to serve him because he didn't feel \"safe.\" Especially after he requested to speak with my fianc\u00e9 again, wait? Weren't you just implying he was a threat and you were afraid? During turbulent times like this, where there's so much racial animosity going in our country, your choice of words is significant and can be detrimental to black men's lives. I take great offense to false implications that can have adverse effects on my family. Since my fianc\u00e9 knew Hyuntae was having a \"Karen\" moment, he got in the car, and we cleared our heads. I shelved my emotions before getting out of the car and asking Hyuntae for his superiors' information and his name. \n\nHyuntae spoke his peace, and I spoke to mine in regards to our previous interactions with him. He said that he could only attest to the interaction that night. Now, Hyuntae did tell me that he signaled two fingers to my fianc\u00e9, implying to \"give him a minute.\" We are paying REPEAT customers; you should address us as such. You finger signal your employees. You DO NOT finger signal paying customers. You vocalize what's happening and ask the customer for their patience. That alone told me all I needed to know about all of our previous interactions and his respect level for us. Well, I hope you respect this review, Hyuntae Byun.

I've had a few Italian subs that aren't bad--like Quizno's--but cheese steaks generally don't work 600 miles from Philly.\n\nI found the place around the back of 116th Street, west of Keystone Ave.  There is plenty of handicap parking close to the door, and I didn't really see it until I moved some slush by driving over it.\n\nThey have a lot of options.  Subs come in three sizes and cheese steaks (including chicken cheese steaks) come in two sizes.  I ordered a regular cheese steak and a drink, for under $10.  I think it was $6.75, which isn't bad, if the sandwich is good.\n\nThe odd thing here is that I had to specify to change the cheese.  In Philadelphia, you can get mozzarella, provolone, or cheese whiz (yuck!).  Here, the default choice was swiss.  SWISS?  That's like people putting green peppers on cheese steaks.  It doesn't happen for me!  :-D\n\nThe person who delivered my sandwich said \"cheese steak, no cheese\" and I said \"no, that should have provolone.\"  So, in a few minutes, he returned with it, saying that it was very hot.  I assume a microwave oven was used.  I don't remember ever seeing cheese on the top of the sandwich in Philly.\n\nAnyway, the bread was way too soft (Amoroso rolls, please!) but the meat was good.  The cheese tasted a bit funny, but that's cheese in the midwest.  It's different from what you get in Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or New York City.  To each his own.  :-)\n\nHe asked about it later, and I said \"It's okay.\"  Later, he asked if there was something that they could have done differently.  We had a discussion about cheese steaks.  It was good that they were receptive.  Everyone else was really pleased.  All I can say is that I was not unhappy.

I secretly root for restaurants at Summit Sierra as they seem to come and go with regularity. This location has had I believe three other incarnations, none of which were memorable. Skipolini's has the potential to buck this trend.\nWe arrived at about 6pm last Thursday and the restaurant was pretty busy. We were told it'd be a 15 minute wait but had just sat down at the bar when the hostess came and told us she had a table. My wife and I chuckled a bit, because several years ago at one of the other incarnations, a bistro, we came in to an empty restaurant on a weekday and were told that we needed reservations. We walked out. Obviously the management here is trying to reverse the building's past karma ;)\nI like the open kitchen and the gelato cart. Gives a good feel and when you are hungry, it's a great advertisement for the menu when walking to your table. \nOur server came by within a minute or so and took our drink orders. Wine and a Newcastle draft arrived shortly thereafter. We did not order pizza- it was pasta for the three of us. My wife and I split a small house salad. At $7 I was skeptical, but it was full of antipasto-type flavor and big enough for two. Very delicious.\nMy mother-in-law ordered the Chicken Marsala, my wife the Affumicato Ravioli, and myself the Papperdelle Bolognese.\nThe Chicken Marsala was served on a bed of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The sauce was too sweet in my opinion but pairing it with the potatoes worked well in cutting down that sweetness. \nMy wife's ravioli really appealed to her- I received no bites as she ate it all :)\nMy Papperdelle was good, but the sauce was a cream bolognese and that tends to cut down on flavor as opposed to a true bolognese. True Bolognese is a sauce that cooks all day, marrying interesting spices along with various cuts and meats. In this I could taste some of the spices, and sausage, and cream, but the whole effect was not Bolognese. If it was advertised as a sausage/meat cream sauce that would be better. It actually was pretty good- just not what I expected. The Papperdelle was the star though- fresh and delicious. You could have that with a little butter and Parmesan and be so happy. Nothing like fresh, well-made pasta.\nOverall, as an Italian American I would have given three stars, but the service was excellent and what they did well at,they excelled so four it is.

The first thing that I noticed when I walked in was the latino radio station playing as the 100% latino staff worked the ovens and register. Not a problem, its just that Joes does not read \"Italian\" in ANY way. Like I said, that doesn't bother me in the slightest; if the food is good, I don't care if clowns cook it, it was just a little weird. \n\nWhat DID take me aback is the next thing; are people supposed to be behind the counter?! As I sat, waiting for my food to be ready, a lady got up, walked behind the counter and refilled her soda and went back to her seat. \"Ooooookay....she must work here or something, or know the owners....\" As I sat, no less than FOUR MORE PEOPLE just walked in, and walked behind the counter. They refilled their drinks, got ice, picked up and touched things, etc. One guy even finished his food, walked behind the counter, GOT CHANGE FOR A 10 FROM THE REGISTER, and left through the back door! And he had like a USPS uniform on, so he absolutely didn't work there. It was SO WEIRD! Is that just like a thing they do here? I'm confused.\n\nAbout the food, I had pizza the night before, so I went with chicken fingers at Joes. The fries were perfect, and the chicken was cooked well enough, even though they were less \"fingers\" and more \"flat pounded chicken.\" The fingers weren't really seasoned and I asked for honey mustard to eat them with. The honey mustard was TERRIBLE. It tasted like old wax or something, and I'm almost positive there was no \"mustard\" in it. It was like, mayonnaise, honey and tortured souls. Yuck. \n\nChicken fingers, fries, drinks and side of regret flavored like honey mustard came to about $10.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Gave this place a try and to be honest, it's FAR from the best taco place in Tampa.

I wanted a taller toilet, but was willing to accept anything that was a little higher than the one we had. The upstairs and downstairs toilets were almost new, we bought them at Home Depot. They are extra-large and sturdy, Kohler toilets. Anthony said the one he was going to bring was ADA approved; January 24, 2020. He brought a new toilet. The toilet was sturdy and of the same quality as ours. Anthony installed the new one. He asked if it was ok? I said yes.\nMy judgement was faulty, I didn't want to sit on the toilet in front of him. A few days passed and we realized the toilet wasn't taller. We measured it and compared it to the old one, it was as tall as the one we had.  What a disappointment. Anthony promised us a higher toilet. He said they didn't make ADA high toilets, after he said he was going to install an ADA toilet, a few days earlier.  \nAnthony didn't give us an estimate for the second job (the new toilet).

Not only did they replace the nicer toilet they first installed with a cheap version, but they also kept the nicer toilet that I bought in the 982.00 bill.\nA few days ago, I went online and looked up toilets. The tall toilets do exist. Anthony lied to us. I want the cheap toilet removed.

They aren't full of pretense (screw you, Tria), they aren't fine dining, but they have a solid menu and kind of a cute decor. Unfortunately, I don't think they really know what they want to be. \n\nOn my first trip there, I met up with a couple of friends who had went there for dinner. Although I didn't actually get a meal, I was impressed with what they offer. They are part of the \"slow food\" movement, which was kind of nice to see. I can get down with that, although if I was super hungry I'd probably get annoyed. The menu also changes pretty regularly depending on the seasons and what's freshest. Love that. My friends loved their meal, particularly the catfish that was on the menu at the time, and I was OBSESSED with my strawberry rhubarb pie. I don't even LIKE strawberry rhubarb pie but this was super good and kind of tart and had a scoop of lavender ice cream on top. I loveloveLOVED it! It took awhile to get, but you could tell that it was literally made to order. I've also had zucchini fries there, which were not what I was expecting but in the best way possible: hollowed out zucchini, \"flowered\", stuffed with goat cheese (omg) and fried. Quite possibly a combination of my favorite things. I want it to never leave their menu. Some day I will try their SHAME burger, but only when I'm feeling particularly gluttonous. \n\nTheir wine and beer list is pretty good. Not as extensive as some other places (in terms of beer, at least), but good and not too pricey. I had a really good chenin blanc there, and they also serve Brew Works Space Monkey in a pint glass! My job didn't even do that, and I think our pours are better than most places. \n\nNow onto the bad. First, service is really hit or miss. My first night there we had a dude server who was really friendly, nice, and on top of things. He even let me taste the chenin blanc before I had a full pour without me even asking! The most recent times there though I had a blond lady server who just really rubbed me the wrong way. She didn't smile much and had a judgmental air about her. Not towards other people, just to me. She messed up my drink order and was super slow about fixing the situation. Also, one night I was there during beer week and not only was there no draft list, she refused to let me see the bottle list because \"they didn't really have much in stock right now\". Ok, fine, but I see people at the bar drinking bottles and a group of people in the back dining area sharing a 25oz bottle of something. I thought that was so rude, especially considering most of the bottles I drink are expensive. Whatever, though. Your loss on raising the check price, lady. \n\nSecondly, although this place is trying to be high-class with the warm, minimalist decor and more refined service (excluding the blond girl), the neighborhood is definitely turning it into a sports bar type of place. It was MOBBED during the Stanley Cup of drunk assholes screaming and falling all over the place. It can get like that during Phillies games too.

Maybe I've been away for too long, but on my most recent trip, I realized two things. First, Philadelphians like Hall & Oates far more than the rest of the country (like, way more).  Second, y'all need to switch up your diets a bit, because slicing, as opposed to chopping steak (or \"steak\") when making a cheesesteak should not be considered such an exotic technique.\n\nI love Steve's and all.  Despite their appearance as a hostile South Philly tourist cheesesteak stand, they are actually very friendly and they make an great sandwich. I love Northeast Philly too, if for no other reason than it feels completely unchanged from when I kid and life seems to roll along here like the rest of the world doesn't matter (or exist). \n\nWhen I was young, I lived not too far from here and actually remembered trying it for the first time because it was the first and only time I had a cheesesteak with cheese whiz (may have been melted velveeta back then).  This time around, I expected Whiz to be the only option, but I opted for a cheesesteak \"with\" on American cheese.  That's the classic combination to me, and of the next ten orders I overheard, the preference of nine others.\n\nHere's the thing though, for all the talk of being the best, I wasn't blown away.  My heart likes the chopped style, but the foodie in me respects the use of non-processed, sliced beef. Its potential is throttled by under-seasoning said meat and choosing a cut, I'm assuming round, that isn't well-suited for a quick cook on the griddle.  It's tough, way too much chew.  The cheese is a little excessive and I couldn't help but think that if there is a given allotment of fat grams, I'd rather have some tastier beef and less cheese as opposed to leaner beef and a soupy mess of melted cheese. Onions we a little burnt too and chopped too fine, but I couldn't tell if that was an aberration.\n\nMy theory about the accolades is that people who compare the many great cheesesteaks of the city in search for the best are tricked by Steve's slight departures from the norm.  A very detailed and impressive list last year placed them as 2nd best in the city and occasionally a publication or two will name it very best.  Sorry, but it's not close.

They were far superior to other famous nearby shrimp cocktail.  The cocktail sauce was okay, but not excellent.  \n\nSalad course was the wedge, which was huge and very good.  Delicious chunks of bleu cheese and bacon.  Honestly, the salad was the best thing I had.  The house salad left a lot to be desired.  Boring and basic.  Unremarkable.  \n\nWe placed our order for two 8-oz filets, medium, mine was ordered oscar style.

They handled this situation with grace and they re-fired our ENTIRE ticket, so that we started with new steaks and fresh sides.  \n\nThe new steaks came out and were better prepared, but not perfect.  Mine was still a little overdone and the other a lil underdone.  We're relatively easy to please, so this was fine.

I was obviously upset because I've been to several nail places where glitter and design is part of the flat rate. They were kind enough to charge me one nail. I wouldn't complain if my nails didn't start chipping after a week. I've been getting my nails done with gel for 5 years and never had nails chip and last me 4 weeks. I only get fills because I don't like my nails to be long or have the outgrown nail show. Also they didn't push back my cuticles or cut them. The shape of my nails were not smooth and round.

You're also looking at birthday party parents who will very much claim they're having a private ride (this is a parent thing, not a Shuckles thing I believe.)\n\nTractor ride takes you around the corn maze, you can see a bunch of broken electronics, a barn storing what appeared to be an air conditioning unit. Here we pass the remains of a kid train that's disassembled, coming up next is a trailer that has a stove and a weight set on it. Yeah, tractor ride through a junky farm area. Meh.\n\nTractor ride over we went to the playground which is universally both good and not enough. Zip line, why not two? Big line on it. Very short zip line. Fort, really nice, main slide shut down, slides on side at too much of an angle causing kids to fly out. Like two bricks would fix that.\n\nAs we were walking through the woods to get to the corn maze there's a bridge over a little river. Down the river there were about 7 tires I could spot just junking up the river. A 5yo who was with us exclaimed \"who put all this technology in the creek!\" as we looked at a 1980's TV, a stove, and something I think was a fridge at one point that appear to have been embedded in the stream for a while.\n\nThe place could be very good. Honestly hire someone for a day to clean up the junk or at least just shove it in the barn and close the door and you wouldn't have what appears to be a junkyard tour.\n\nLet's talk about the corn maze. I've been going to corn mazes for probably the last 30 years and this is the first one I didn't complete. I'm honestly not sure who's fault it was, but the maze was unnavigable. Trying to tell the difference in some places between the maze and the paths that had been torn/trampled down was not possible. At one point I followed one path to a very obvious exit and nope, it wasn't, they'd used a bale of hay to mark it wasn't an exit because so much had been trampled down.\n\nAt this point they really need to invest in a red ribbon to mark off what is and is not the maze.\n\nOverall, quite possible to turn this place around to great - drop the pay for everything additional, clean up the grounds so we're not touring a used tire and appliance dump, and put some hay in the mud pits around the main areas.

I never had something like that before.\nThen the food came, I really like my lasagna, it was different in a good way. Great flavor! \nWe all had the pizza and it was delicious! I loved the pizza dough, the pizza sauce, and I think they cooked it just perfectly!\nI had a bite of the short ribs and they were yummy. \nWe ordered a second garlic bread, and then we shared a \"Tiramisu.\" the tiramisu was not moist, but it had a good flavor.  \n\nThe only thing I did not like was the wine. I had a glass of Merlot, and my friend had a glass of cabernet. We had to switch them because we did not like the ones we got. Maybe in the future, they will have other wine options.\n \nThe Service:\nService was great! The server checked on us regularly. She made sure we had waters and everything we needed. She gave us some recommendations on what to order and explained to us the sizes of the small plates. \n\nOverall: Great Food, beautiful place, and amazing service. \n4.5 Stars \nYes definitely coming back.

These spicy potatoes not only have perfect texture, being super crispy on the outside while still soft inside, but the seasoning is immaculate. If you're a garlic lover, this dish is for you. We also got the pistachio spread which was a little tangy and refreshing. I loved the pomegranate seeds on top and the whole thing just tied together well. I came with one other person and we only got one entree, the mashawi combo. Honestly, I did enjoy the appetizers more but this was still super yummy! The chicken wasn't dry and the beef wasn't overcooked. The lamb was very tender as well. It comes with hummus and an eggplant spread. I don't typically like eggplant, but if it's in this spread, I'm suddenly a fan.

One of our all-time favorite beers is a Banana Wheat so we were bummed that wasn't on rotation but that's not their fault! \n\nThey did offer a Peach IPA instead of the Mango but I didn't care much for it, but I do love Mango so I was really bummed to not be able to try it. \n\nWe got their Wheat selection (forget the name), the Copper ale and the New England IPA. \n\nThe IPA was very good, I enjoyed it very much. The Wheat was solid and the Copper Ale was okay - I preferred the IPA. I hope they put the Session back in rotation as the warmer months are coming up quickly. \n\nI think prices are a little on the high end for where we were, Bordentown.

Uhg sent it back and I didn't even order another drink because it would be made by the same bartender, so no thank you. \n\nFor starters we ordered the mac and cheese bites and house made kim chi, we were also given their complimentary corn bread fritter drenched in their bourbon honey. I love honey and I love bourbon but these weren't good corn bread. \n\nWe got our Mac and cheese bites in less than 5 min from ordering, it came topped with what we thought was very bland tuna salad which turns to be smoked trout. It wasn't Smokey nor should it be on top of Mac and cheese bites? The Mac and cheese bites were also bland, I don't know what type of cheese was used but it tasted like it was just b\u00e9chamel and then coated with bread crumbs and fried. \n\nThen the house made kim chi, simply tasted like sauerkraut. Not spicy, salty, no umami just sour. But I like sauerkraut so that's a plus. Which I didn't order, I ordered kim chi..\n\nOur mains were classic burger med rare with fries and fish and chips with Brussels sprouts. The burger patty didn't seem house made and it came out unseasoned and rare and cold, my kid said the tastiest part of that burger was the brioche bun. Although he did like the house made ketchup. \n\nMy fish and sprouts, it wasn't bad lo. I just wish the fish wasn't borderline soggy. Like it was crunchy but when you pick it up it falls apart soggy? \n\nThis place looks good and food presented well but it lacked flavors. Where is the salt, something? Was it a bad day? Did we order the wrong things? No it should all be good, right? The server knew we were not happy with anything we order, but what can he do? \n\nI wanted this to be good but this is one of those looks can be deceiving type of place.

But seriously, it's nothing like the processed meat products you get at other roast beef chains, or even from the deli case at the grocery store. This is your grandma's roast beef, cooked rare and sliced so super thin you can see through it if you held it up. They scoop up a handful of the heavenly stuff and plop it on a buttered bun and then covered it all with seasoned salt. \n\nI like it with BBQ sauce, but I know lots of people who opt for the horsy sauce or au jus. \n\nAnd where else do you have a restaurant where almost everyone orders just one sandwich...that is just meat on a bun. Yes, it's that good. \n\nThe fries are good too. I like them with the seasoned salt or a side of cheese sauce if I'm feeling thin that day. \n\nAnd the ice cream concretes (think DQ blizzard if you aren't a STL native) are a wonderful treat.

It looks like it's a sort of tex mex inspired menu. I got the border Benedict poached well done because I do not like runny egg. The sauce is amazing on top very creamy and not too spicy. The corn cake was a nice flavor combo with the sauce. It  included carne asada on top of the egg and a generous amount. I would order this again, and the home fries were not too greasy either. I hate when they are extra greasy, making my stomach churn. The ladies are very attentive with refilling your coffee as well. I also had a bite of my fianc\u00e9s sweet potato pancakes and they were flavorful. The short stack was plenty for him and they are big pancakes.

I went at their peak lunch hour and still managed to get my take out order within 15 minutes, I think that was reasonably fast. I will agree with the other comments here regarding the service. The lady at the counter taking orders was definitely not friendly. However, this seems like a place where you come to get good cheap Cuban food and that's about it. It's not in a trendy part of town, the exterior and interior decor is unremarkable, and the service is subpar. Still, I think if you adjust your expectations you'll be able to appreciate this place for what it is, delicious authentic cuban food. A little tip for the pros, skip the flan.

Everything started out nice. Our waitress Vicky was wonderful and super knowledgeable about the menu, specials, and for making recommendations. We ordered a bottle of wine, the brussel sprout appetizer (which i highly recommend), and a wedge of the skillet cornbread. I decided on the Chilean sea bass which game with veggies and rice with an Asian flare to the dish. All of the above was wonderful and I wish we could stop their which would be a solid 4 or 5 star experience but lets get into what knocked us down to a three star.\n\nFirst off on our window ledge had two dead flies on it. Understand this happens in restaurants but when cleaning and turning tables this should be checked and wiped off. Next my wife decided on the prime rib which was the whole reason that we chose the Redstone American Grill. The prime rib was cooked more to a medium almost well and we had ordered it medium rare with a warm red color. We didn't complain about that since it was tender and had good flavor. We also don't like to send stuff back unless we have to. Next up the baked potato was not hot and the cheese was congealed and must have been sitting out for a few minutes too long. The potato also had under cooked bacon on it, no thanks and they forget the butter the best part! We sent back the potato and got a hot one with just butter on the side to be safe and efficient. \n\nNow lastly, the dessert my favorite part of the meal. I ordered the peach cobbler which was on the specials and I immediately regretted my decision. I have never saw a cobbler that looked or tasted like this. It was more of a dense piece of bread with a very small amount of peaches. Then you would think even a small scoop of ice cream instead I got tons of warm whipped cream.

We arrived at 4:30 and needed to be at a graduation around the corner by 6:30. Should be no problem, right?\n\nWe started with some appetizers. They call them \"shareables\" but there is no way you could share those tiny portions. I had the hummus. Tiny amount of hummus, tiny amount of pita, a few sliced carrots and cucumbers. The meatballs were also not shareable. \n\nMy mom had the $25 salmon and swapped the 2 veggies for other veggies. They tried to charge her $8 per swap ($41 total) for this. To top it off, the portion of salmon was about 1/3 of the pre-sliced pieces they have at the grocery store. It was barely a meal. Another person got something that said it was a \"salad\" but was just a few beets with the food. I ordered the Brussels sprouts and they were so flavorless and greasy that I sent them back. I understand that normally they are stuffed with bacon but surely you can still make Brussels sprouts that aren't undercooked and have some flavor? If it requires bacon for a vegetable from your kitchen to be palatable, you're not much of a chef. \n\nThey managed to completely forget my moms hummus and my dads meatballs, which they claimed we never ordered but they managed to appear on the bill (despite us not receiving them) so they clearly just forgot to make them. My dad had luckily also ordered a wedge salad, which was literally just a head of lettuce chopped in half with a little blue cheese and tomatoes. No presentation, nothing on top of the lettuce - it was literally \"here is a piece of lettuce and some stuff next to it, and a cup of dressing\". And this somehow took about an hour to prepare. With 3 people in the kitchen. \n\nOne person got the \"scallops\" - when you order scallops in a nice restaurant, you expect large scallops. The last thing you expect is those tiny little cheap scallops they sell in the store. But that's exactly what she received - tiny little scallops about the size of a dime. This is completely unacceptable. \n\nTo top it all off, the service was the SLOWEST I have seen in my life. We were the only people there when we arrived, and yet it took so long for the food to come that the graduates had to shove their meal down and get some of it to go. It was an hour and a half from when we sat down to when the meals came. Then we tried to get the check, and 25 minutes later we didn't have the check and were about to just leave since we had asked multiple times for it (we aren't missing a graduation because it's taken 2 hours for this). Then we had been charged for things we shouldn't (substitutions at $8 each, the food we never even received because they forgot to make it) but there wasn't time to even fix it before we had to go. So we overpaid in cash and left, since we didn't even have time to wait what I'm sure would have been an hour for them to run the credit card. \n\nTheir excuse for the check taking so long was that we asked for a few checks for different people, so she had to do that. And yet I saw her taking checks to other people rather than doing ours. It's like the concept of \"we're in a HURRY\" was a foreign language. They offered to leave us sit for half an hour longer while they prepared the food they forgot to make - but we DON'T HAVE TIME for that. \n\nMy mom asked for the manager and was told there wasn't one on site. That might explain a lot actually. She was told the head chef was there, so she asked for him, but he never even came. \n\nI was still hungry since my Brussels sprouts were soaked in grease, and my dad was hungry because they forgot to even make his food, so we got veggie chicken sandwiches in the stadium. They were much better than the food here, much quicker, and actually reasonably priced.

Yes, it's convenient because it's half a mile from the home I moved into in March. Since then I have become familiar with the store and have grown to love some of the staff who work here, but that's not enough to keep me. The shelves are consistently empty and mislabeled. For months they were out of baking yeast and flour. Last weekend I came in and there was poop in the aisle that spans the length of the store. The staff said it belonged to an animal, but given the state this store is often in, that's questionable. I ended up leaving my cart in the middle of the store and walking out.\n\nKnowing better but for convenience sake, I stopped by again this afternoon to pick up a few things. Booze here is cheap, so I grabbed a bottle of whiskey I was excited to try called Redneck Riviera. I was at first gonna go with a cheap Evan Williams bourbon until I saw that the price tag for Kentucky straight Redneck Riviera was only a couple dollars more. At least that's what the price tag said. \n\nWhen it came time to pay, of course only one of the machines (they usually only have one cashier for the entire store - forget that!) took cash, so it took longer than normal to check out. I scanned the whiskey last and it rang up as $25.00 even though the price tag said $12.98. I asked one of the nearby associates if she could honor the price tag and she said no. She said I probably grabbed it from the wrong spot or that price was for the smaller bottle. No and no. I read the price tag correctly and Redneck Riviera only comes in one size. Then I asked if there was a way she or another employee could do a price check and she again said no. I'm not sure why not - any other store would have done it. \n\nI think it's sad that this store doesn't care about customer service. At the end of the day, they know they're Walmart and people will spend money there regardless, but that's no excuse to give bad service. As a word of advice, never mess with a girl and her whiskey.

The long wooden bench is strategically lined with pillows, which is awesome for back comfort.  The Tropical Smoothie came out shortly after I returned from washing my hands. What does a $9 smoothie taste like? Freaking amazing, that's what! It was better than Smoothie King, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, and Jamba Juice. The consistency was perfect; thick, yet not too thick.  The flavor embodied the essence of \"tropical.\" This smoothie should be the cover girl of island smoothies: easy, breezy, beautiful. If they brought in sand and a pond, they could charge resort fees. I loved this smoothie!\n\nThe chef, Joe (if I heard correctly), was toiling away behind the glass across from where I was sitting. He confirmed that my order was sans tomatoes. As he reconfirmed what I wanted my wrap to include, he said \"cheese.\" I have always hated cheese, even pre-vegan. He proceeded to say it's a cashew vegan cheese. I declined. My friend, who once owned a vegan restaurant in Chesterfield, had me try it and I hated it.  The chef persisted. As he brought over a sample for me to try, he boasted, \"You haven't tried MY (vegan cashew cheese).\" By golly, he was right! It was yummy!\n\nThe Tempeh LTA (ordered as a wrap) came with flavorfully cooked tempeh, cashew cheese, lettuce, avocado, and mayo-lined sprouted grain wrap. Everything tasted so fresh and clean, with a winning combination of flavors, including that vegan cashew cheese. (Thank you, Chef, for your persistence!) The dish came with round tortilla chips and a simple but delicious side salad. I inquired about the dressing on the side salad. It's justly called Goddess dressing, and is made with tahini and herbs. It may be my new favorite dressing; too bad I couldn't buy a bottle for the road. This dish is worth every penny of the asking price, and is on par with places like True Foods Kitchen.\n\n\nYes, it is a little expensive, but the quality (remember, everything is organic too) makes it a great value. \n\nI do agree that parking can be a pain.

It's as though they do a lot for show. The first time I called Hutchinson it was to have a service guy come out and fully inspect my HVAC and get the heater ready for the winter. He did a great job and was extremely knowledgeable and informative. The second time was to have the condenser inspected and cleaned out to prepare it for summer. The service man found that the coolant was very low and was checking my HVAC for leaks. He left holes in my air ducts and left without covering them up. Instead of coming back right away to patch the holes, they scheduled me for a week from the time he initially came and I was then left with a lot of air leaking out of the ducts in our utility room during an extremely hot week. They did not seem to care about this or apologize. I then had a \"home comfort specialist\" come out to check out my condenser and the entire time he was under the impression that my HVAC needed to be replaced when we made it very clear it was the condenser. I realized he was not a Plumbing/Heating/Cooling expert but a salesman. When I received his proposal he was not even willing to work with me on the price when I told him it was outside of my budget. He just said he would only hold the estimate for me for one month which I was very disappointed over. Usually if your customer is going to shop around you want to make sure you guarantee that your customer is satisfied instead of simply letting them go when your initial estimate is outside of the stated price range. And he also did not apply the numbers (discounts) properly to the proposal which threw me off a little.

I'll go back and update the review when I have a second go if it changes anything. \n\nThe reason I'm mixed is because we paid $50 to reserve a bay, but when we got there it wasn't available. The staff was very nonchalant about it, and actually suggested it was our fault for paying the reservation two days in advance and not double checking again the day before. Our card was charged the $59 and they had all our info,  it they actually told us it was our fault for not double confirming. I pointed out that it is not typical to have to double confirm a reservation made-- especially if a $50 fee is attached to making that reservation. If they expect people to confirm the day before on top of that-- they should say so since it's not standard practice to ask customers to do so. They response was that they were \"much bigger than a restaurant\" so we should have called to make sure it was in order. That didn't make sense to any of us. \n\n Until I started showing that I was upset with their response, they didn't even offer any kind of gesture of apology. Paying $50 to reserve a bay does not go toward the playing costs-- it simply guarantees you can immediately access a bay to play-- no waiting. So, to have paid $50 and not get the benefit the the bay actually being saved was annoying. \n\nThe staff was a bit condescending about their response to the situation as well. The male manager stood uncomfortably close to me and said \"what can I do to make you happy\", but when I started to tell him I thought they should refund the reservation fee, he interrupted me and told me I was being rude. I wasn't cursing or yelling so I was pretty astounded that he would cut me off to say that after asking me a question. I turned away told him I was just answering his question and pointed out I wasn't yelling or cursing and that it seemed like he wasn't interested in my answer-- Then he apologized and let me finish. At that point- per my request, he agreed to put the money we paid for the reservation toward our game time charges. \n\nThe female lead on the deck we were on kept coming by after we got started and saying things that were a bit pointed-- like \"Are you guys having fun now?\" ... like, emphasis on \"now?\".  :/\n\nAn odd thing to say when it was them that created a crappy start to the day. Yes, we were moving on and putting it behind us, but those comments felt like loaded digs instead of genuine check ups. \n\nOverall-- the act of actually playing was SO fun. I would love to do it again.  But the experience I had with the staff makes me hesitate. I filled out their customer service survey afterward and asked to be contacted by someone so that I could explain the score I gave, but no one contacted me. I'm torn between wanting to go try again and being wary of another situation coming up where I'd have to deal with condescension and rudeness. It was a bad look for them. \n\nIt seemed cultural-- not situational because they were very comfortable being illogically rude when we had a very good reason to point out that they had charged us for a service they did not provide. \u200d", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Unreal experience at the Donelson Strike and Spare today.

If we don't like it, what alternative are we going to use? None. This is what Sun Tran realized when they decided they don't have to cater to anyone.\n\nThe people who complained about Sun Tran though clearly aren't from the area or never use public transportation. To be honest, I feel lucky that this city even has public transportation. This is not New York or San Francisco or Minneapolis and it never will be! It sucks, but that's how it is. So please, don't bother comparing Sun Tran to other cities because the idiots running it will never learn.\n\nThat being said, Sun Tran is an embarrassment. Now, usually the buses actually ARE on time when it comes to leaving and arriving to and from the major stations. And usually they are on time at the major stops listed in the route guide. I say this as someone who regularly rides the bus almost five times a week and have been for years. So obviously those of you who said otherwise don't know what you're talking about...\n\nBut back to the embarrassment. There are several renegade drivers who violate a major rule that all buses need to observe: you do not EVER leave early. If a bus arrives late, this is annoying, but arriving and leaving early means that someone who arrived at the stop on time will now be as much as thirty minutes to an hour late, as opposed to maybe ten to fifteen minutes. The worst part is that I have arrived at the bus station ten minutes before a bus was scheduled to depart, saw the bus departing, and even waved at the driver to stop and let me in. It had barely left its spot, but she refused to let me board and just drove away. This is unacceptable. Almost always when I miss the bus, it's not because it's late, but because for some reason it left early.\n\nI believe we have the cheapest public transportation in the country. But for some reason they keep raising the fare and keep taking away services. They used to have a service/information booth but took that away. Fine, the poeple who worked there were rude and didn't know how to do their job. They used to have a nice swamp cooler running at the Ronstadt station during the summer. Not anymore. And those aren't very expensive or difficult to maintain. \n\nAll in all - it is what it is.

After 20 mins of the horse only wanting to fight me on going forward i had no choice but having to get a guide for help. When the guide arrived, he even was having trouble getting Tonka to do what he wanted and said tonka was acting strange. We have now wasted 30 mins of our trail time bc tonka didnt want to go I suggested maybe I should have another horse and was told it would be another $10 to change out horses.

After some time the guide who was very nice was able to get tonka to go out but our ride was cut short bc of time wasted.

Hot pot is basically a communal eating event - you sit around plunking thinly sliced meat, seafood, and veggies into boiling hot broth at the table, wait for it briefly to cook, and eat it with an array of DIY condiments/sauces for dipping. \n\nWhat hot pot comes with:\n1. Choice of broth (regular, spicy, or half regular half spicy)\n2. Meats: Beef, pork, lamb (defrosted, thinly-sliced), beef tripe\n3. Seafood: unpeeled shrimp, squid\n4. Vegetables and things: Napa cabbage, tofu, rice noodles, enoki mushrooms\n\nThere is a condiment station behind the buffet where you have a selection of 10+ sauces and toppings. You come here to make your own dipping sauce. You make your own combo to taste. Condiments include satay, sriracha, oyster sauce, sesame sauce, peanut sauce, black vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, garlic oil, minced cilantro and green onion. \n\nOne pot is good for 3-4 people. \n\nThe ingredients for hot pot are okay quality and limited in variety, and service is kind of lackluster, hence the 3 stars.  I almost never have enough belly space to sample from the buffet, but it is nice to grab some fruit after I'm done numbing my tongue eating hot pot.

The prices on the website and the actual prices at the warehouse are drastically different, as many other reviewers have stated. I definitely got the \"bait and switch\" feeling. The website states that they have 1990's tee shirts available for $2 each, but when I got there, all the tee shirts, even blank shirts, were $7, more than double the price published on the website. And keep in mind they cherry pick out any tee that might actually be worth money, such as a band shirt, for example, which they tend to sell for around $40 and up. So the $7 tee shirts are basically similar to what you could get brand new at a discount retail store. Also advertised on their website were $1 pieces. No $1 pieces of any kind were available at the warehouse. The nicer dresses and beaded jackets, which I routinely pick up at thrift stores for around $3-$5 each, were priced starting at $25 and going up from there. For a dealer, the warehouse \"open to the public\" section is much, much more expensive than your average local thrift store, and I was surprised that their website stated they welcome dealers. As it turns out, there are better prices available when you buy in bulk via private appointment...with a $500 minimum, that is. Regarding the customer service that other reviewers have complained about, I can honestly say I had a good experience in that regard. I was greeted by a very sweet young lady who was responsive, polite and helpful. Maybe they have improved in the customer service arena after they saw some of the previous complaints.

Otherwise, you have to wait in line and they will skip you and seat other people who are there with their entire parties.  It can get crazy when there are huge groups of bachelor parties in front of you.  On top of that, there is no setup for a line.  There were some arguments that broke out and people were upset thinking that they were in line the whole time.  Just be ready for a mess! \n\nOnce seated, they are pretty quick at taking your order and serving you.  We ordered the three dozen Chargrilled Oysters split between six people.  They come smoking hot to your table and bubbly with the melted cheese.  They can be very rich but they are definitely different and different meaning good.  \n\nWe also ordered three dozen raw oysters to split as well.  They serve Gulf Oysters which are thick and large.  I'm more used to the smaller varietals and felt that it was a bit too much for me.

The crust was that perfect chewy crispy NOT the thin sliced pizza I see all over S Jersey. The pepperoni is great. Pizza had the perfect amount of oil on it. Garlic knots were great. The godmother sandwich (chicken parm with vodka sauce) was fantastic. The chicken was really nice and crispy, not a mushy mess . It had numerous slices cut on the thinner side rather than 1 too-thick slice. My only comment would be that I couldn't taste the vodka sauce all that well. Whether it's because it was a sandwich & it soaked into the bread, or just not enough sauce I'm not sure, but it needs some more of that vodka sauce flavor. I'd still order it again and maybe just request extra sauce on the side. The food was delivered and still HOT. The value for what I ordered was fantastic.

There was more than ample meat on the pizza. The cheese was extremely gooey. Think provel. The crust was wafer thin. Like a cracker. These are all good things. The only blemish here. The pizza was bland. The pizza lacked spice of any sort. I couldn't detect any basil or fennel in the Italian sausage. No oregano in the pizza sauce. I couldn't even taste the sauce itself.

Because cigarette smoke can ruin just about anything enjoyable.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI am pretty extreme with my view of cigarettes: I detest them.

And so, for about 150 obvious reasons, I don't smoke cigarettes.\n\nI also don't feel like I should be subjected to smoke via other people. ESPECIALLY when I'm at a place that's a claustrophobic person's nightmare. During the Interpol concert, we were all packed in like sardines. \n\nBut unfortunately, everyone around me decided to be selfish and provide me with their smoke in my face throughout the night. It made my concert experience thoroughly unenjoyable. I would strongly urge Jannus to not allow smoking in the venue. If they do want to allow it, make smokers go into a designated area.\n\nAside from that -\u00a0the concert was listed as 7:00, which is when we arrived. The opening band didn't even start until after 8. We quickly found this information out, and that there was no re-entry.

Only go if you have no other choices.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Squeal is bringing real Southern BBQ to the Uptwon/Riverbend area, but there are a few problems that need to be worked on for the place to be as indispensable as The Joint. While the meats themselves were smoky, flavorful and cooked to perfection, and the sides I sampled were mostly great, some of the peripheral concerns - service, ambiance, the \"house\" BBQ sauce, and some of the non-BBQ dishes - were definitely not up to par during my visit.\n\nMeat: the St. Louis ribs were delicious. We got a full rack for the table, and they did not disappoint. The \"bark\" from the rub was delicious, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. I know there are some differences of opinion out there on the \"correct\" level of rib done-ness (some say they should stick to the bone and retain some chewiness), but I'm a fan of the fall-off-the-bone doneness level, so it didn't bother me. The pulled pork was tender and not grainy at all. The chicken was flavorful, even though the white meat was dry. I was not able to sample the brisket, as it had run out when I visited. Our waitress, who was very nice but was definitely flustered and \"in the weeds\" during our visit (despite the fact that the dining room was far from full), said something to us that indicated that the meat may be pre-smoked and then warmed in conventional ovens to order, which is disappointing, and probably accounts for the dryness of the chicken. However, this process did not ruin the pulled pork or the ribs.\n\nSides: The collard greens were excellent. The bacon & jalapeno mac n' cheese was good, although there was not enough bacon or jalapenos to significantly alter the flavor of the dish, which was a standard, if well-executed, dish of penne pasta with a creamy white cheddar sauce. The roasted corn & cheese grits were very good. The cole slaw was average.\n\nAppetizers: The black-eyed pea egg rolls were yummy, similar to a southwestern egg roll that you might get at a chain restaurant, but with a Southern twist that made them better and less typical. The jalapeno corn hush puppies with honey butter were awesome, the best hush puppies I've ever had. Three hush puppies come with every BBQ platter.\n\nThe not-so-good: My sister is not a fan of red meat, so she ordered the fish tacos. They were awful. The fried fish used in the tacos had a strong fishy smell and taste, usually a clear sign that the fish is not fresh, and may in fact be going bad. The taste and smell was so objectionable that she could not even finish one taco. We told the waitress about the problem, but the tacos were not removed from our bill. Another problem was the house sauce. The primary flavor notes were sweet and spicy. There was no vinegar taste at all. This wouldn't have been a problem if Squeal had - like many other BBQ places - offered a few different sauces to suit different tastes. We asked the waitress if there were any other varieties we could sample, but she confirmed that the default sauce was the only sauce that was offered.\n\nService: The dining room is small and dominated by a gigantic big-screen HDTV usually tuned to sports. The size of the screen makes it difficult not to stare at, which is a problem when you are dining with a group and end up being antisocial because your gaze is captured by the giant luminescent hypno-box. The walls of the restaurant are covered with art that so kitschy and terrible it is distracting: NOLA Neo-Impressionism is the best word for it, even though that makes it sound more important that it is. It sucks. When I visited, our waitress was breathlessly running around, so busy she could not be attentive. We waited a long time to give our orders, get our drinks refilled, etc. Some of our requests went unfulfilled: we ordered sweet tea and never received it, we asked what the fish of the day was and were never told. It was strange because as far as well could tell she only had three tables to serve. She was very flustered and could not answer many questions about the menu, which may indicate that she is new.\n\nThere are isolated aspects of Squeal - the pulled pork, the collard greens, the egg rolls - that are superior to The Joint, the other contender for NOLA's best BBQ. However, there are enough major negatives - the sauce, the service, the weird ambiance, those awful fish tacos - that make Squeal, in the final analysis, not nearly as appealing as The Joint.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "This is an absolute disgrace.

Naturally I arrived before everyone else to scope the place out.  The bar is original and has that typical 1930s/1940s look to it but what was really cool was the use of the mirrors.  Maybe it was the sign behind the bar that said \"We don't serve women.  Bring your own.\" that kind of sold me on the place as well. \n\nThe bartender was very nice and took my drink order.

Let me tell you what...this place is AMAZING.\n\nParking/Location:\nThere basically is none.  If you live in this area of Carrollton, you know what I am talking about.  Best bet would be to take the street car if possible, and if not, just understand that you are going to have to be patient unless you luck out and find something right away.  The place is a tiny old house set back on Carrollton between Juicy Luicy and the bank on the corner.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe place is small, but decorated beautifully.  Perfect for a date, or a dinner with friends.  There are a couple of tables out front on the sidewalk, so if it's nice out and you aren't trying to do the romance thing (traffic, sidewalk traffic), it could be fun to sit outside.  Again, this place is SMALL.  I would say if you are going on a Friday or Saturday night...call ahead or hit up OpenTable for reservations.  We made reservations on Sat night for 6:30pm and were seated immediately.\n\nService:\nOur server was very nice, prompt and chatted with us, I would say, just the right amount.  She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed, and was very good about recommending dishes and explaining the nuances of the menu items.\n\nFood:\nGood wine selection and the drink menu looked fantastic.  We opted for a couple of glasses of red (Pinot and Cab, can't honestly remember the names).\n\nWe started out with the oyster appetizer and it was great.  Cornmeal fried oysters with a chili aioli and apples.  The oysters were perfectly cooked and all the flavors complimented each other wonderfully.\n\nMy wife had the diver scallop entree and she loved it.  We are both huge fans of scallops and must say these are some of the best I have ever had.  They were cooked perfectly (pan seared) and melt in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes were tasty as well and the presentation was nice.\n\nI had the double cut pork chop and HOLY WOW.  This was one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life.  The pork chop (cooked medium and pefectly) was thick, juicy and the flavor was throughout the meat.  I'm not sure what that marinade was, but it was outstanding.  Wonderful char on the outside with a roasted red pepper jus that will knock your socks off.  The crispy onion strings were a good compliment to the pork chop and the Jack Daniels and roasted corn coush coush was killer as well.\n\nFor desert we had the pecan pie tart with homemade bourbon ice cream.  The pecan pie was good, but the ice cream was the star here.  Very strong bourbon flavor which we both loved.  Perfect compliment to the sweetness of the pie/chocolate.\n\nPrice:\nPrices are more than fair for the quality of food, the ambiance, and the service.  It's no more expensive than any other restaurant of this caliber.  For a couple, expect to pay about $100 (before tip) if you have wine, one appetizer, two entrees, a dessert + coffee.\n\nConclusion:\nGO.  You will not be disappointed.  I really have NO idea how some of these folks gave this place 3 stars.  It must have been an off night is all I can say.  My wife and I will DEFINITELY be back.  If you go, and you are a meat eater...GET THE PORK CHOP!", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Came here to satisfy a late-night craving, but more specifically because I just recovered from some type of stomach bug and had dropped several pounds over the past few days due to a loss of appetite, and I did not want to lose any more weight so I needed a few extra calories in my day.

I chose the snickerdoodle and sugar cookie, and the whole milk. Though they still had an hour left til close, and multiple employees on site, the cookies were handed to me cold and seemed to be in the beginning stages of going stale as they were a little hard.\n\nI have had Insomnia Cookies in the past, and a hallmark of these cookies is that they are served warm. It's an absolute defining feature of Insomnia Cookies. Though I didn't eat them until I got home, I specifically felt the cookies in my car before I pulled off, to see if they were warm. They weren't, and I couldn't be bothered to go back in and ask them to warm the cookies for me.\n\nNot good. Won't be back. Considering that two cookies and a tiny bottle of milk cost me more than $7 with tax, it just isn't worth it.

I know her from outside of the yoga studio environment.  She sat down next to me and asked if I had done this type of yoga before and a bit about my experience.  She checked in to see if I had any injuries or special needs.  It was nice to have someone take the time to do that.  She appeared grounded and focused form the moment I walked in.  \nThe class began with a little singing.  She peppered the class with music and singing throughout.  She is a local musician and brought her guitar.  The singing and music felt natural and lent itself nicely to the poses and feel of the room.  She held the relaxed energy throughout the class.  She offered variations on the poses and approached things in a gentle calm manner.  This was a very therapeutic class in a no pressure environment.  \nHer sense of spontaneity came through in the use of music.  This music may have been planned ahead but it came across with ease and spontaneity.  When someone is comfortable doing something they are able to take risks and pull new tools out of their pockets and it adds to the experience.  The music did not distract but kept everyone in the poses and facing the challenge.\nThe emotion she put forth seemed to be a combination of joy and empathy.  This emotion was sustained and carried us through the class.  Honestly I was so deeply into my own experience I had trouble noticing anyone around me.  I do believe she helped a person or two with props etc but it was seamless.  We ended the class with her singing and the class joining in.  Music and chanting is such a wonderful thing to experience during yoga class.\n2.\nTeacher:  Poep Sa Frank Jude Boccio\nStyle:  Mindfulness/Insight Yoga\nIt was a morning class and I generally do not do morning yoga classes so this was new for me.  I love yoga practice in the morning and will do a short one at home but rarely drag my butt to a class in the morning.  \nI arrived and everyone was getting lined up like they knew the drill.  This led me to believe they are regulars.  He came across as relaxed and yet fully alert.  He was excellent at guiding us into the postures and guiding us to feel and notice what was going on in the body.  He did something unique that I found really helpful.  Instead of getting out of a longer held pose and getting up and shaking it off, he asked us to sit with it for a minute and notice what was going on in the body.  He truly had a mindful approach and cultivated an environment of noticing.  The practice of insight meditation when applied to yoga is a powerful combination. Insight meditation tells us to notice what is really going on and see things for what they really are.   He was excellent at letting us know not to strive too hard and relax into the poses.  He came across as benevolent and unpretentious.  The class had the right amount of movement and stillness.  He kept the energy going and a kind smile on his face the entire time.  It was a great experience having a class with a former Buddhist monk.  He exuded accomplishment and humbleness. \n3.\nTeacher:  Alyssa Kratz\nStyle:  Mixed Hatha with Gongs (Gonga Yoga)\nI stepped into the room and marveled at all of the gongs lined up near the far wall.  Some of them were huge.  There were two musicians sitting in front of the gongs with drums, singing bowls and other percussive instruments.  The teacher walked right up and introduced herself to me.  She gave a good firm handshake and asked if I'd ever been to one of her Gonga Yoga classes before and I said no but that I was looking forward to it.  I told her I was a musician and was very interested in what she was doing with sound and yoga.   There were strings of lights around the room which made it nice and dim (not too dim).  \nAlyssa (teacher) made her way to the front of the room and read a quote from Jack Kornfeld (Vipassana Buddhist teacher).  \nThe music began, first with singing bowls and drums and later evolving into cacophony.  I was almost a little annoyed with the music at first, but once we started moving I appreciated it.  It helped to hold the space and get me through a challenging flow type class.  Alyssa commanded the room well and seemed to have a gentle strength about her.  Her voice was clear and instructions concise.  She wasn't throwing in any uneccesary words or fluffy language.  She seemed brave in front of the class and really worked with the feel of the music.  The musicians worked well with what she was doing too as  they seemlessly switched instruments and changed feel along with the asanas.   \nAlyssa's character was warm and accepting.  Though the class was challenging I did not feel at all like I needed to be competitive.  She created an environment of openness and acceptance.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Not my ideal place to eat,  but we were traveling and didn't have much to choose from.

Tiny hot water heater, never enough for a bath. Heat pump hvac which is essentially electric heat, so astronomical utility bills. Maybe it used to be a fun place, but while I was there, there was constant turnover, and most people moving in were kids just out of college. No sense of community. Useless property manager who has been there for 25 years and has gotten way too comfortable in her job. I actually never saw her doing anything but gossiping with tenants, if she was even there.\n\nMoved in from out of state. My 2 bed 2.5 bath bi level was not ready. I had the maintenance staff in every single day for weeks. Never heard a peep from the office staff to check in or apologize. The second floor had a strong smell of pee/Ramen noodles. Filthy under fridge and stove. Nobody could figure out what it was. Every time I put the ac on, this horrible, dank basement smell would come out. Started coughing, wheezing, was nauseous. Reported this to property manager, she said she would take care of it. A month later, nothing done, I had private testing done to check for mold in the system. Every sample came back at the highest levels possible. Vents covered in mold. Then started the bullying and intimidation from the higher ups at Reinhold Residential. \"Everyone has a bit of mold in their HVAC\" etc. Seriously. They finally scheduled a remediation. They clearly didn't want neighbors to see the guys in remediation suits, so they hired an air duct cleaning company. The guys came in and said they weren't trained to do this job. A horrible person from Reinhold, whom we had been forced to deal with throughout this ordeal and was just, frankly, a thug, told them to proceed. I was told no chemicals had been used in the system except a deodorizer, although all vents had been removed and taped over with wood. I checked out a vent after they were done, and got a few good lung fulls  of some sort of chemical. Eyes, mouth, chest on fire. Told afterwards that they had used a biocide in the vents. Done by untrained workers who didn't allow it to air out.\n\nI can only imagine that Sharples gets away with all of this because the building is cool, they allow dogs, and the housing market is so tight in West Chester.

In the interim, we needed someone to give us some advice about doggy doors and to install one before we move in--either to replace a glass door with a wooden door and install a doggy door in it, or to enlarge an electronic doggy door in a wall. Dan suggested that we enlarge the existing doggy door, and remove the motor and wiring, as we only want a simple doggy door, and said he could do it, in spite of the fact that it's an 8\" thick wall with stucco on the outside. We were very happy about that, and I ordered a doggy door that will fit. But Dan went way beyond this request. He noticed that the previous owner had set up a kind of unstable landing and blocks to serve as stairs for their dog when it went through their small doggy door to the outside. Dan suggested that he build a permanent landing and steps out of redwood, which would be much safer, especially since one of our dogs weighs 71 pounds. We really appreciated that and look forward to having all of this done before we move in. \n\nBut, on top of all of that, as Dan was walking through the house to get to the existing doggy door, he noticed a toilet continually flushing, wasting an enormous amount of water. He immediately called us, shut off the water, and we asked him to please fix the toilet, which he did, right away. What a relief, as we hate wasting water, especially in a drought, and in Santa Barbara, where water is so precious.\n\nWe also wanted 2 gates installed on either side of the house, so our dogs wouldn't run out into the street. Dan advised us to have the gates installed by the fabricator, and said his very nice wife, Kirsten, said he could come by and watch to make sure the gates were installed correctly, with combination locks and self-closing latches. In the interim, since it will be October before those gates are installed, we were very happy that he could make us some temporary gates and have them up before our move.\n\nFinally, we somehow couldn't get the digital locks on the doors to the garage to work. Dan went over to the house, was able to set a new combination for us, and also provide us with the master passcode in case we want to add or change anything in the future.\n\nAll of this is priceless, as we're overwhelmed with packing and moving after 33 years in our current house. It just takes an enormous burden of worry off of us, so that at least our dogs will be safe and sound in our new home, and we'll have full access to the garage. Thank you so much, Dan and Kirsten! We have a lot more work we need done to our new house, and we'll probably be asking for your help again and again!\n\nHusband here:  although I ran a physical science lab for young people, I remain woefully low in fix-it skills.

The eastside is more tolerable for our preference without the bright glare. The bar is relatively small with 7 bar stools, 5 two tops and 1 large table for 8.

The manager was also checking with tables to confirm all was well.  Water glasses were refilled often and we were checked on several times throughout our meal.  Our appetizer arrived early enough to finish before our meal arrived which is a HUGE plus in my book. We were pleasantly surprised our lunch arrived quickly afterwards with the restaurant being full. \n\nWe began with the Tarter Skewers as an appetizer. The potatoes are peeled into corkscrew strips, deep fried on a long wooden skewer and served three to an order with two dipping sauces for $6.99. They basically are a very crispy, thin potato chip. Very cute idea and the presentation caught several customers attention asking what they were.  I personally do not enjoy extremely crispy homemade chips but my husband does. That's on me and not the restaurants fault but I'm glad I tried them. If you enjoy homemade chips, I'm sure you'd enjoy. \n\nMy husband enjoys spicy food and burgers so he ordered the Jerk Burger with fries ($9.49) along with a Preacher's Daughter Ale. He was disappointed in the size of the patty and the bun overpowered the amount of beef.  His feedback was the burger was ordinary but perfectly edible; Just not worth a 45 minute drive.\n\nI tried the Trojan Burger with fries, subbing chicken for the burger, and found it very tasty. The chicken was tender, not overcooked and I enjoyed all the topping with the tender chicken breast.  I would recommend and I'd order again. They only carry Pepsi products so it was water for me. \n\nOverall the restaurant is fine to grab a quick sandwich or drink if we lived in the neighborhood.

The chargrilled oysters are as good as other reviewers say they are and lived up to our expectations.  \n\nHOWEVER, we still loved the raw oysters more. That's because when you cook an oyster, you basically kill the natural flavors and they become whatever ingredient you put on them.

He told us it would be two weeks for the blinds to come in.\n\nFour weeks go by...called Bob to check in, mailbox was full and he never picked up. Sent numerous emails to no response. Finally he emailed me back, and this was during the start of the Thomas fire and he let me know he had been evacuated but would call me the next day. He did not call but I figured I would give him time to get back to me given the circumstances.\n\nI called and emailed again multiple times but could not get a hold of him. It's now been 6 weeks. I let him know that I will be reporting him to the BBB as well as taking proper actions with our legal help. Completely unprofessional and unacceptable to take such a large deposit and then disappear on any sort of communication.\n\n*UPDATE* finally heard back and he installed 3/4 of our blinds the next day.

However, if you have tiny kids, avoid the city museum for a few years.  Seriously, it's just not worth it for little kids.  \n\nWe decided on a whim to go to the city museum.  I knew it would be crazy but I was picturing crazy along the lines of Magic House.  This was crazy along the lines of a zombie attack.  We paid $5 to park which isn't bad.  But then we saw the line to get in.  Honestly if I'd seen that I probably wouldn't have bothered but we thought \"Hey, we already paid for parking, let's give it a shot\" and we got in line.  The lovely dad in front of us decided to smoke a swisher sweet the whole way in. Because that's just awesome.  I love smelling like cheap cigars on a hot summer day.  About 15 minutes later we got inside and waited another 10 minutes.  We paid $26 for two adults.  And it was a madhouse.  Screaming everywhere, kids running everywhere, crying, yelling, fights between siblings . . .  Way too many people to even move.  We opted to get some food and you practically had to kill someone to get a table.  And the table and highchairs?  Filthy.  Just vomit-inducingly gross.  Covered in wet spots and food. The family that had the table before us just left a pile of sopping napkins and a half eaten jalopeno. I got out some wipes and did what I could.  We choked down some of the food and went to go find the toddler room which was bleh.  A pit of dirty looking balls and a slide.  There were a few other things but older kids were on them and acting like crazed beasts.  Couldn't see their parents anywhere.  My toddler was so freaked out by the noise and the rambunctious older kids that he didn't want to do anything except tentatively play with some old dirty wooden blocks for a bit.  Then we tried to walk around as much as we could but the crowds of people everywhere made it impossible.  We ended up leaving after an hour.  I thought it was a complete waste of money for a toddler.  Maybe we'll go back when he's 10 and he can enjoy everything more.\n\nBut seriously, if you have a little bitty kid, avoid it.  Go to the Magic House.  You can barely get a stroller around anywhere and there is nothing at all for your kid to do and the older kids get super crazed everywhere.

It is expensive just to be looked at for a total of 5 minutes and you will probably be waiting to be seen for about an hour because there is not enough staff. Additionally, the doctors are horrible and probably shouldn't be doctors at all. A few months ago I had nasty rash which they diagnosed as shingles. They looked at it for 5 minutes, did not do any tests, and sent me home with a prescription for over the counter anti itch cream and told me it would be gone within a few days. Within a few days I was hooked up to an IV machine and was being pumped with antibiotics for a staph infection (which by then had spread up my leg and onto my stomach). This drew the line for me and I vowed to never return. But a recent case of strep throat caused me to go in because they were the only clinic in my area open on a Sunday. They tested for strep immediately but the nurse swabbed my tongue not my throat. While I'm not a doctor, I do know that you have to be absolutely stupid to not know how to do a proper strep test as a nurse. Big surprise, it was negative.

I hate going to the gym because I have no idea what I'm doing there and I hate wandering around aimlessly from machine to machine.  At Lithe, I get to mindlessly succumb to the demands of the (very sadistic) instructors.  \n\nNow, I've always been the least athletic person in the room (any room), so I can't keep up with all the exercises, but I'm working up to it.  I'm just hoping that one day I'll be able to keep up with the curtsy-sumo combos and ridiculous pushup/plank marathons like some of my freakishly strong co-exercisers.  Slowly but surely, I'm improving, and my butt, thighs, abs, and arms look better than they have in years (since I had to stop going to Bar Method in the SF Bay Area).  The instructors are all great (though everyone has their favorites, of course), and the classes are fun and dynamic, but tough as hell.\n\nI highly recommend that everyone start out with Immersion--even though it's kind of a rip-off at $150 for 6 classes, and sometimes it can go a little slow, it really sets the foundation for all the other classes, which move really fast.  And even though it felt like we were barely working at all in the first Immersion class, I could barely walk for days afterwards--it really works muscles you never knew you had.\n\nA few criticisms: I wish the instructors would walk around and give some more individual guidance, I wish there was a Saturday afternoon class, I wish there were 8:00 classes aside from Immersion (though they actually have a ton of evening classes that a working person can actually make it to), I wish they would get some new gliders, and I wish there was more stretching at the end (like Bar Method).  \n\nBut if Lithe gives me the body (and the cholesterol reduction) I want, as it seems to be on the way to accomplishing, I'm willing to live with those things.

All the toppings were fresh and plentiful and the woodfire oven adds a nice crispiness and char to the outside of the crust. However, the crust was too thin to support the multitude of greasy toppings and sadly became soggy in the middle. In addition, the sausage was crumbled too finely (almost reminiscent of the burnt bits leftover in the pan after frying), not the hearty chunks I would prefer, and the fried spinach on top of the pie that already had bacon and oil just added another layer of heavy greasiness which didn't help with the sog factor of the crust. \n\nWe also ordered two house salads to accompany our pizzas, which were fresh and delicious. Sadly, I was unable to try the other menu items which include a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers with innovative toppings.

We ordered and watched more and more people come in. I heard the bell chime when orders are up and got ready but curiously no food showed up. I knew that the longer it took the colder the food was going to be and sure enough. When the waitress brought the meals it was cold as ice. Inedible. Now the server was too busy telling another couple all her tales of woe and I had to flag her down. I told her all the food was cold and she actually acted surprised but said she would have it all remade. I had the Havana Omelet with grits, wife had 2 over medium, bacon, french toast and we ordered a side of chorizo to try it. The meals came out again and were hot but our cuban toast which she brought out way before bfast #1 came out was ice cold. here's the meal rundown:\nHavana Omelet - Looked like a 3 egg omelet with ham, chorizon and cheese. It was ok. Hard to explain, it was just ok. My grits came out cold and lumpy. So cold the butter wouldn't melt. That's cold.\nEggs, bacon and chorizo and french toast - The first eggs (cold) were cooked perfect. The second set were undercooked and had runny whites. This makes it inedible to the wife. Her bacon seemed fine and the chorizo, meh. The french toast was very cinaminny but, again, nothing special. They aslo did not have sugar free syrup which we both use.

If you are changing or updating them on ANYTHING, it means nothing unless it's in the contract.

We had house beer and wine selected, but a hour into the event we found out they had margaritas, sangria along with any beer and wine available. \n\n2. The open bar will be gone within the first hour, somehow, the one bartender pushes out $1700-$2000 in your allocated bar tab before you even arrive. Hmm. But when you ask (if you even notice), they have no proof other then the bartender and servers clicking the button the amount to get there. (No cameras)\n\n3. Make sure you let your guests know not to put their drink down, as drinks are placed on tables servers come back around and clear them even when full. \n\n4. Keep track of your cake. They take it and \"cut it for you\" but half our cake went missing and we never saw it. They claimed they handed it all out and trashed the rest but half the group never got any nor did we see it all come out. \n\n5. When you pay your final tab at the end make sure the planner is there because they want you to handle things when your trying to leave, won't show you break down of costs and for some reason the manager Troy, Gm Tyr and all others \"didn't know how to pull up a break down of how we got to the price we did??\"\n\n6. They charge for cork fees, that's fine.

In addition to the bath products you can indeed make your own perfume using the scents you find right as you walk in the door.\n\nSo I was excited and immediately started uncapping scents to try... And then, disappointment. Maybe it's the carrier oil they use, but nothing, not even the true essential oils, smelled right. Everything was muddled and slightly sweet. It wasn't just weak... the smells themselves were wrong. It was like smelling a candle that didn't quite get the smell right.\n\nThe best example of this was when I picked up something that said \"Colombian Coffee\" and called the person working the store over because I thought the top cap had been switched with\"Chocolate.\" She smelled it and then another coffee and said that the scent was correct, their coffee was just very chocolaty. Yeah, no joke. There was no coffee in there, or maybe it was just one of those horrible flavored coffees. Keep in mind that because I've done this before many times I know how orange and patchouli and verbena are supposed to smell. These were way off the mark. And I darn well know what coffee is supposed to smell like because I literally spilled coffee on myself fifteen minutes before walking in the store.\n\nI'm not against synthetic scents, either. I've made my own perfumes at a place in Castleton mall from synthetic scents, and they were great. Unfortunately, that place went out of business twenty years ago. Sensing a pattern?\n\nSo if you're looking for a true make your own scent place and you are looking to get a certain effect with essential oils, don't waste your time here. I can't imagine being able to make a truly good signature scent out of the thirty or more scents (both essential oils and synthetic, of many different types) I smelled. It won't smell like perfume. If \nyou're lucky you'll smell like weak potpourri.\n\nHowever, for parties and gifts and for most people just casually looking for something different they will probably love this place. Just be prepared to smell lots of things and leave any preconceived notions about how each scent is supposed to smell and you'll probably be fine. This place enables people to get a somewhat unique scent, while still treading on safe ground. So for that reason I give it three stars...but in my own book this place is one star at best, and not worth my time or money.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "I come here to pick up lunch often.

First we were a few blocks away and now we are literally around the corner from it. That is to say, for the past two years we've been living around this restaurant and the years we have been stationed here in Tucson, \nwe have never eaten here. We were walking to Target when we realized we were hungry( we love walking for some reason). He suggested Great Village since he has been wanting to try the place for a while now. So we went. It's such a tiny building in the midst of shopping centers and stores so it has a hole-in-the-wall type of feel and look to it. My husband and I always say that if a restaurant has security bars in the window or is in a sketch part of town then you might be in for a great meal. They have security bars in their windows and we had an awesome meal lol. \n\nWe were seated in a booth. They weren't busy during this time. We ordered water and explored the menu. Our waiter was very clean and nicely dressed. You could tell he took pride in his uniform and seemed to have some sort of formal training. He was so proper, nice and fast. He had our water, soup and meals out before we could even blink. He even picked trash and dishes from the table as if preparing for the next course. He was awesome. \n\nHubby ordered the sesame chicken and I ordered the Mongolian beef. Both meals came with rice and soup. I ordered the egg flower soup and hubbs ordered hot and sour soup. The soups were sooooo good! I absolutely love egg flower/egg drop soup and they blew my all time fav egg drop soup out of the water (Sorry Ba-Dar). It had cabbage and green onion that combined with the broth and egg so amazingly. So much flavor. I loved their Mongolian Beef. It wasn't the usual sticky,thick sauce you usually get from other places. It was lighter and just the right amount to cover the meat. The rice was amazing as well. Although nothing special was done to it, it tasted seasoned. \n\nI tried my husband's sesame chicken and it was sooooo good. It tasted like orange chicken with sesame seeds(time to say goodbye to Panda Express orange chicken). I honestly wish I had gotten the sesame chicken. It was that good with the right level of spice. With all the food we had gotten, our bill was only $17! This is why I will forever love Chinese food! We were sooo full and still had lots of leftovers for later. \n\nThe one con to this place is the decor. It's somewhat lacking. There was a mound of boxes at the front of the dining room but they attempted to disguise it by putting potted flowers and sign on and around it. So I gave it an A for effort. It could also use a bit of scrubbing/remodeling but it wasn't extremely bad so I let it slide. That was the only thing I found wrong with this place.

It was a four person table (I've never seen this before) but one of the sides was broken and they duct taped the goal shut.  Unfortunately the tape created a ramp for the puck to fly up and off the table striking several people in the heads as they walked by.  We played for a little while but were bust chasing the puck that flew off the table and apologizing to people.\n\nOverall it was okay.

We were on one of the larger boats and I am not sure why anyone would pay a premium for a smaller boat. All of the boats seemed to end up in the same corners of the swamp. Our guide was Ryan and he was the highlight of the experience. He was funny, knowledgeable and seemingly blessed with eagle eyes. There wasn't much wildlife to be seen, but he was able to spot a small alligator and a few snakes. He even tried to catch the snakes. He grew up in the area and was clearly comfortable navigating the swamp. We did learn that March is not the best time to see gators. They are more visible in April/May during breeding season and when it is warmer in general. Even though we didn't see much wildlife, it was great to get outside of the city to see the swamp. It did get chilly when the boat went fast so bring a sweater. And shame on the one person who thought it was ok to secretly vape on the boat.

It's the ultimate comfort food.   \n\nIf you hear 'chicken liver' among the specials, it's your lucky day.  They're savory, melt-in-your-mouth tender without a trace of bitterness. Apple adds a subtle touch of sweetness.   (I love them.  Even a confirmed liver-phobe at my table called the dish 'amazing.')  \n\nFor desert, the apple cake is excellent, not too sweet with a loose, moist texture,.  But the real after-dinner star is on the appetizer menu.   Rozmaryn's blintzes filled with farmer's cheese whipped into fluffy obedience with just a hint of cinnamon are not to be missed.   \n\nRozmaryn is pure comfort - delicious food, homey hospitality and friendly prices.  \nGo.

I think I went to Sunset Grill a few times for happy hour about four years ago and just never went back after moving away from that part of town. It's been open since 1990, so I figured it's about time to give it a real shot.\n\nSunset Grill appears to have done no updating to their decor since they opened in 1990. Let's just say that it reminded me of a Manhattan apartment of a coke-sniffing Wall Street Banker circa the late 80s. What grabbed my attention most was the artwork- apparently all done by the same artist that was probably super cool when I was in elementary school and now just reeks of the first Bush administration. I think Sunset Grill could stand to do themselves a big favor by updating their space. There's a large room with tons of windows -which is great- all they need to do is change the paint color and update the art. With how much I've been ragging on restaurant art lately I might as well start a blog called \"Your Art Makes Me Lose My Appetite.\"\n\nFor cocktails I went with the Sparkling Cider which was made with apple pie moonshine, Prosecco and honey water. This was possibly the girliest moonshine drink I've ever had- but that's a compliment! (I am a girl afterall.) There was a very mild apple spice flavor that worked well with the bubbles. Steve ordered the Velvet Elvis which was made with Jack Daniels, Chambord, sour mix and soda. This was Steve's first time having this cocktail and while he said it was solid, he felt like the drink was just not his style.\n\nThe restaurant week menu at Sunset Grill allowed you to get one appetizer and one entree for $20.14 from a limited menu. For my appetizer I went with the half order of shrimp and grits. I really liked this dish! The shrimp were still tender and the grits had a mild tobacco spice which added heat. The pickled okra garnish was a great addition... mostly because I can eat a jar of pickled okra and consider that dinner.\n\nFor his appetizer Steve went healthy and ordered the Sonoma salad. It had field greens, apples, almonds, blue cheese and a garlic-zinfandel vinaigrette. While everything worked really well together and the apples added a nice crunch, this is the kind of salad that you find everywhere now. Despite being derivative, everything was fresh and crisp, and the apples+bleu cheese combination just can't be beat.\n\nFor my entree I chose the smoked pork chops with greens and sweet potatoes. This was the right choice for me and I knew I would like this dish as soon as I smelled it. The chop had a very smokey flavor to it and was super tender. The maple demi-glace added a nice sweetness to the smoke. I enjoyed the sorghum sweet potatoes even though I came across a cold spot in the center of the pile. The mustard greens were not really my thing. First of all, they were left as full leaves making them hard to eat as you had to dig your knife in to cut them up. Also, they weren't boiled nearly long enough, making them very tough. I pretty much didn't touch the greens after my first bite.\n\nSteve went with the Mississippi delta catfish. The dish was served with Benton's bacon butter beans, dill remoulade and crispy shallots. Compared to the amount of food I got on my plate, this dish was a significantly smaller portion. The fish didn't have nearly the amount of Cajun spice we were expecting, making it a much milder dish. But the way the fish was seasoned worked well with the lightness of the dill remoulade and the creamy deliciousness of the beans.\n\nOverall we had a pretty enjoyable dinner at Sunset Grill. Our waiter was very nice and super attentive without being overbearing. While this isn't really the sort of restaurant I would go to often, I was pleasantly surprised by their offerings.

Crispy char, buttery flavor...seriously a great steak. 20 oz for two people is almost more than enough when you get sides. But, here's the thing. They basically slapped the steak on the table with a poblano pepper. $50 for a steak and that's the presentation that I get? I know that is nitpicky, but I just thought they would have done something better.\n\nThe sides were good. The fried Brussel sprouts were tasty, the fries were nice and greasy, but holy crap Batman.

Like too much even for my taste and I am a sodium addict.\n\nThey leave you a bottle of water at the table which I always appreciate (especially when the food tastes like it was made in a salt mine).\n\nService was great.

I wrote this review several months after visiting, but it was simply my experience. It was pretty slow and it was an odd time (between lunch and dinner). Seemed short staffed, maybe someone was sick or at their break. I don't ask for a manager for several reasons. We tried mac and cheese and coleslaw. They were fresh but bland. The meats we tried were the ribs and tri-tip, both not very warm, but smoked nicely if not a bit dry for my tastes. We tried every sauce you have to offer, including odd ones like the rootbeer sauce and a berry sauce. Chivers I've purchased for myself from the grocery store and it's a step up from ketchup in my opinion. The only reason I recommended two other spots is because they both make their own sauce(s). They don't have a ton of options but their options are good.

As for the main course... you can choose different types of fish which is a great idea. \nThe fish itself wasn't bad, nothing I would rave about either.  You could defiantly tell it had come from a freezer... but not soggy and gross.  I was not a fan of the batter though.  The batter wasn't thick - actually rather thin coating - and it seemed to be inconsistently coated.  And the batter was almost too crunchy, maybe it was the thinner coated spots that were the problem.\nThere were only 6 people in the restaurant, yet my fries were cool and hard.  If you can't be bothered to have the time to make fresh chips at a slow time, you may have to rethink if you want to be in the restaurant business. \nIn the end I think I've had better fish & chips at corporate restaurants, so I probably wouldn't go back.

The presence of WWII veterans there was also amazing and I was very thankful to speak with some of them.  It was a unique experience to hear from someone who was actually defending oppressed countries in Europe and Asia.  It wasn't just defending the United States, our country was tasked with a losing situation:  saving so many countries from the grips of untold and horrible oppressors and had to mobilize very quickly.     \n\nThe layout of the museum is a bit weird, lots of stairs.  They should let in a certain amount of visitors per floor so that one does not feel crowded reading the placards and going through the audiobooths.

There is  movie narrated by Tom Hanks is a must see which encapsulates the experiences of our soldiers during the war.  \n\nFinally,  the museum IMO is one-sided.   I wish they had also interviewed, captured and  recorded accounts from people in Asia and Europe,  people who were conquered and oppressed, so we can understand the horror, destruction and devastation these people went through.  I also wanted to hear more about the African American experience in World War II.   There are an ungodly number of people who would like to express their thanks, my parents from Asia for two, and Im sure countless others who are eternally grateful to what Americans did during WWII.   I think hearing everyone's accounts would round out the user experience at this museum.     The United States managed an impossible feat and came through for the world during those times and had we lost, the world would be a much different place today.   \n\nI will always support this museum and other ventures that help educate our country about oppression, the war  and slavery.

Many of the people I pick up there complain about the place.\" \n\nMy first clue should have been a stern warning from the front desk attendant, who humorlessly admonished us that we could check out early, but would be charged a one-night penalty if we did. Obviously this standard warning is born out of experience from prior guests (or victims, as we now call ourselves). Our first room was essentially uninhabitable and confirmed that the warning was necessary - filthy beyond words, with dirt, grime, and hairs (human? animal?) in literally every crevice and corner. I went to the washroom to freshen up and realized that I would probably be leaving with biological parts from hundreds or thousands of prior guests and other creatures. My husband and I seriously debated switching hotels, but the Grand Prix weekend had most options booked. The front desk allowed us to move to a \"suite,\" although if there's a less appropriate word to describe our next room I'm not sure what it is. The suite was only slightly better, with at least fifty less human parts per square inch of bathroom than the previous room. I will say that if the first room hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in thirty years, the \"suite\" had perhaps been well-cleaned sometime in the last fifteen. \n\nI've described the filth, which probably provided enough airborne pathogens to shorten our lifespans by twenty percent. It goes without saying that the towels were all stained. Miraculously, the sheets, pillowcases, and bedspread actually appeared clean (although it was never re-made during our four-night stay). It's as if all of the cleaning effort was placed on the bed and nowhere else--almost like the cleaning staff felt guilty and created one dirt-free oasis. This pleasant fact was countered by the single most disgusting thing that I've ever found in any hotel room in my life: a used condom. Actually my husband found it. Other reviewers have complained about the lack of an alarm clock in the room-- that's like Mrs. Lincoln complaining about the play. One note about customer service: You'll see some other reviews that present a similar commentary about the rooms, and management responds that they are \"Shocked, shocked to find that gambling is occurring at this establishment!\" Just kidding. That was Casablanca. Management responds that they will ensure that the situation won't happen again. One recent response suggested that, if given another chance, the guest could be assured that their room would be \"immaculate.\" This was several weeks ago. How hard is it to do a good scrubbing of the baseboards and clear out the used condoms?\n\nHere's the tragedy-- the resort has a great outdoor space, mostly friendly staff (there was one sour bartender, but all of the others were nice), and so much potential. If they would just run a cleaning service through the place and do some minimal upgrades, it could really be a destination resort. \n\nI'd like you to keep two things in mind as you consider this review. The first is that no words exist to describe how bad our room was, so my commentary is really not doing it justice. The second is that the pictures I attached here are of the BETTER room.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "I had an issue with my MacBook and took it in for repair.

When I asked if I could substitute honey (which was listed as an ingredient in my smoothie), I was told the smoothie would not have had honey, anyway, so I couldn't substitute anything for it. Smoothie was good, nice texture, not too sweet.\n\nPlace is clean, with tables to sit. The older couple that was working when I went were efficient. Refrigerator for bottled drinks.

All of them were stupendous and were seasoned perfectly.\n\nOverall, the best feature about Edison isn't the food to me, it's the staff. Our bartender(I wish I caught his name) was incredible. He offered guided suggestions on what to drink/try/eat - all were great. He was engaging, witty, friendly, and he really knocked it out of the park for me.

We were all highly disappointed with the food. The presentation was lovely and it all looked very appetizing, but there was absolutely no flavor to the dishes. The best things we ate were the egg rolls and the chicken wings. The other dishes were so bland and lacked any flavor. I hate to say it, but I felt the Chinese dishes in the buffet are much better.

I am so glad that I did not make reservations at another well-known brunch place down the street. It is because of this oversight that we ended up at Coquette. I am so glad we ended up here. This was my most favorite meal during our trip!\n\nMy husband and I both decided to order the 3-course brunch. For the first course, I ordered the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo. This was the best gumbo I've had in NOLA. I'm sure there are several varieties and each person has their own style/preference but this one... I just loved. Smoky. Savory. Full of flavor. A bread slice added in, soaked with gumbo broth. Super delicious. I enjoyed every spoonful. My husband ordered the Crab Risotto with shiitake mushrooms. This was very delicious, not too crab/fishy tasting, savory, creamy, loved the mushrooms.\n\nFor the 2nd course, we both ordered the pork cheek. We tend to order something different so as to try more things on the menu. But this time, we just couldn't. Let's just say, I'm glad we ordered our own! The pork cheek was tender, juicy and flavorful. Sweet and savory with the pepper jelly. A small kick from the jelly, then sweetness. Mustard seeds gave a nice tang. All on top of a soft biscuit. Absolutely delicious.\n\nFor the 3rd (and final course), I ordered the granola parfait. Light and airy creme fraiche. A hint of sweet honey. Light citrus. It was the perfect amount of food for my last course. My husband ordered what he called a deconstructed oreo. It was good but a bit too chocolately for our liking.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable of the food on our plates. I was very pleased that he was able to answer our questions about the mysterious herbs on my husband's crab risotto, and the seeds on our pork cheek course. There was somewhat of a wait between the courses but I didn't mind, seeing as the extra time helped me digest my food for the next course. Coffee and water were refilled often, our bread basket was always full. We had a nice window table, which was lovely, and the decor is beautiful... classic and chic.\n\nAgain, I am so glad we stumbled upon a 5-star place!!", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Staff is friendly, especially Adam and the pizza is a good value for the money.

The only spot without a wait was at the bar, but I think we would have done much better waiting the 20 minutes for a regular table. For one, you don't get the free chips and salsa here like you do at a table. And secondly, we were there over 45 minutes before our food ever came.

The plate highlight was the margherita pepperoni that I can get at 7-11 and the peppadew peppers that were a very small part of the whole.

In the center was a big ball of abbruzze spread that was very strong and seemed a bit out of place. The artichoke hearts were fine but again just a small part of the plate and the sweet soppressata was just meh. Finally the cerignola olive. There were five of them, I ate two  (following my rule of try everything twice) and threw the rest away. I NEVER throw olives away, I'm the olive guy that eats them out of ppl's salads that don't like them.\n\nThe long hots were on the greasy, wet side and the stuffed peppers were unremarkable which was very disappointing.

My dress looked amazing and I got so many compliments on it the whole night. However, getting to this point was incredibly difficult.  I live out of town and had two appointments scheduled for alterations before the wedding week (which they told us would be ok). The first appointment, we worked with Marilyn, who promised that all the changes would be made by the second and final alterations appointment. We show up for the second appointment a few weeks later, and she had forgotten to make all the requested changes except for hemming the dress. This was incredibly frustrating because I was going to get in town three days before the wedding, when we were already booked up with hair and makeup trials and other appointments. And after discussing the changes at our first meeting, we had asked Marilyn if she needed to write all our alteration requests down, and she said she would remember them. To make matters worse, she never even apologized for forgetting. But we couldn't do anything, so we scheduled two more appointments for the busy week of the wedding. We get there the Wednesday before the wedding, and the dress didn't fit and other parts of the alterations weren't done the way we had requested them (we had talked about a belt and sleeves being done a certain way, and Marilyn had had a great idea how to do them. However, she apparently forgot and did them completely differently than the three of us had discussed. And then acted annoyed that she would need to fix it). We also told her the chest would need to be taken out a little as it wasn't covering enough, and she was extremely annoyed and said \"Well, that is going to take me a really long time.\" We get there the next morning and there are still more things she needs to fix, and she tells us we need to come back in later that morning. We told her we had other appointments that morning as it was two days before the wedding, and she said, again very annoyed, \"Well I have other appointments too.\" We came back in twice that same day for the other fittings, and she said \"Well if you hadn't had another appointment, I could have gotten this done a lot sooner.\" Even though it was her fault she had forgotten in the first place and we had told her originally I had other appointments two days before my wedding! To sum it up, we were in there four times within 24 hours and she was consistently very rude. Even my mom, who is nice to everyone, was extremely shocked at her rudeness and lack of customer service.  The icing on the cake was that I got a call the morning of my wedding (which they knew it was) requesting payment. They wanted to charge $900 for everything, including labor, but the fact that Marilyn didn't write anything down was the reason there was so much labor and she had to redo things so often.  Luckily, after talking with a different person and explaining the situation, we were able to get a more reasonable price. Marilyn does do great work and the dress looked wonderful---she was just very rude to us and made me feel like I was a huge bother for wanting my wedding dress to look how we had originally discussed. My advice would be either to work with Connie, who is very personable and doesn't act like you are a pain in the neck when explaining how you want your wedding dress to look.

We soon won't be able to live here.\n\nA more current issue is the letter we just received stating that we are no longer permitted to have propane grills We have had ours since we moved in, along with many of our neighbors.  It was ALLOWED when we moved....charcoal grills were not. We cook out all summer long as to keep our electric bill down. We just signed our renewal last week and nothing was mentioned about this happening or we would have not renewed.  They say it's a fire hazard yet we are permitted to use electric grills which require running extension cords into the house which is dangerous. We also received a letter in our mailbox regarding a small garden angel that we have outside.  We are told we are not permitted to put anything in our garden area, which pretty much looks awful as they continue each year to plant dead plants.  As much as we pay in rent we should be allowed to make it our home.

We actually came here because they were doing a chocolate stout night, with about a dozen or so interesting chocolate stout picks on draft. Coming from someone loves this style of beer, I have to say that they made all the right picks in forming their lineup. \n\nFood: Food had mixed reactions out our table. I wasn't that hungry and ordered the chicken fingers. The good part is that they were clearly made from scratch. The downside is that there is some kind of structural flaw with the breading, as it falls off the chicken as soon as you dip it into the housemade honey-dijon sauce. This should be pretty easy to fix, but would be a big difference. My wife enjoyed her beet salad, which came on a nice bed of frisee and was nicely dressed, and others at the table enjoyed the burger, which was cooked to the requested temperature and had a beautiful red color to the meat. \n\nOverall, I would come back here.

They had well lit thorough photos. I made an appointment for after work. Nobody is expected to know everything about every trim level of every model, but Hassan seemed to be pretty knowledgeable. When he didn't know something he wrote it down and said he'd find out for me. I had done a fair amount of research, so I knew the answers to most of the questions I was asking. Hassan was honest and helpful the whole time, through the entire buying process.\n\n When I showed up for my appointment Hassan was waiting for me. I didn't realize it at the time but there was also another couple in the  showroom who was also interested in the car.  They had to wait to drive the car because I had an appointment. After I test drove it Hassan handed the keys off to another salesman who test drove the car with this couple. Before they got back I put a deposit down on the car  to hold it.  I later learned that the couple that test drove it after me offered to buy the car.  But, because I had put a deposit down on the car they were not able to purchase the car.  Keep in mind this is a very well priced car with very low mileage  for a certified pre-owned 2016.  The next time I could see the car and go through with the deal was a few days later, this was a stressful time for me because I did not personally know Hassan before this and did not know if he would sell the car and refund my deposit if the other couple were perhaps to offer more money. If the employees at Scott Kia were not honest they would have sold the car the first chance they got, but this situation showed me that they are trustworthy! Hassan held the car, had it detailed, and a dark spot on the driver's door wet sanded off. The cabin air filter was not changed, so they changed that too. \n\nI paid in full, the transaction was an absolute dream. I cannot stress this enough. I was ready for a high pressure sales pitch. I calculated what I thought the final check I'd have to write should total, I was off by only a couple hundred. I was not even offered extras like seat protectant spray until after the deal.  And when I was offered the extras it was correctly assumed that I would not want them. Kristin explained everything very clearly for us and even left the room to take care of other parts of the transaction when she knew we wanted to read all of the fine print. Ridiculously generous! It's like they know there's a better way of doing business and they make the changes to improve!\n\nAfter signing only a handful of papers, Hassan was willing to take as much time as we needed to connect our phones to the car and get all the technology set up. With the sale being wrapped up he asked if he could have a photo of me next to my new car for his website. This is important because it shows Hassan takes pride in his work. I also got a thank you letter in the mail about 2 weeks later.\n\nIn contrast, Murray Kia of Conshohocken made me wait a inexcusably long length of time to enter my license into their computer system when I went to test drive one of the cars on their lot. I don't think the salesman knew how to do it. He was older. Then, within 3 minutes of exiting the showroom, walking toward a vehicle, the Murray Kia salesman told me he has prostate cancer. I don't appreciate this unsolicited personal information. It had no bearing on what was going on. Also, everyone should know it's policy at Murray Kia for the salespeople to make you wait for a manager come to talk to you before you leave. I don't like everything about that situation and I don't appreciate the social discomfort it forced me into. Scott Kia didn't waste my time like this. I'd been to Murray Kia before and been thrown around by their sales department, it's their standard operating procedure. Scott Kia was different, they were respectful, matched my calm demeanor, ect.\n\nEvery step of the way the employees at Scott Kia are working hard to break the stereotype of aggressive used car salesmen.

You really can't beat the large kitchen either. \n\nThat being said we hesitatingly just renewed and have regretted it.

Unfortunately things have just gotten worse. \n\nThe trash compactor is always broken so there is ALWAYS bags of trash placed around it. During the weekend is the worse because although a maintenance staff person is there on the weekends they let the trash compactor remain broken until Monday. To me there is nothing worse then pulling into my apartment complex just to be greeted by a pile of trash. What a health hazard! They also posted a typed up sign and taped it next to the compactor with instructions and then they wrote between the lines another sentence. I plan on taking a picture. It is so unprofessional and quiet frankly hard to read! Seriously don't they hire educated people?\n\nAlso they do a poor job in the maintaining the grounds. The mulch has not been replaced in over a year in the back of the complex. They keep up the front because when they take you around they only show the front areas. Should you want to visit Tortuga make sure you ask to view the entire complex. Its like night and day. Where there is suppose to be mulch there is just dirt and a few dying plants. The area around the lake never gets mowed which is a hazard for the dogs. I have two and I am constantly worried about them going out to that area, but there is no where else I can take them. The complex is not dog friendly although 4 out of 5 residents have dogs. They also fail to maintain enough doggy bags. \n\nSo to sum up our rent is over $1600 for a two bedroom and although we have a nice apartment unit the complex is in poor condition with a constantly broken trash compactor that hardly gets fixed so there are always piles of trash and poor grounds maintenance. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place as really there is a lot more stuff I can say, but to describe them would give away who I am and I prefer not to say anything about that until I am moved out. I wouldn't want management to retaliate in any way. \n\nMy advice for anyone looking to rent at Tortuga is to really take a tour of the entire complex and come on Sundays so you can see the trash pile up.

But... who was going to listen to us make our interesting choices and take them back to the kitchen? That was a fairly big outage - we were hungry, and our server was ghostly.\n\nOnce we got our order in (two for brisket, two for cochon) we enjoyed the fried alligator and gumbo. It was good gumbo, but not much differentiated from other good gumbo on the trip. The fried alligator tail was every bit as good as folks have said. Yep - order it.\n\nAs for dinner, the food was good. My friends both really enjoyed the brisket, and the volcanically hot mac and cheese side. My friend and I thought the cochon was good, but maybe not as special as we had hoped. The twice-baked potato side was gigantic, and is very shareable (as was the mac and cheese).\n\nOur server was slow on keeping our water full, slow on taking our orders, slow on bringing dessert menus (really??), and slow on our checks. The only time he really perked up was to tell us about the best topless bar outside of town, which was weirdly enthusiastic. Almost uncomfortably so. I would have preferred to hear more of that enthusiasm or passion for the food we were ordering.\n\nSo, if I were to be back in NOLA, I would probably go to Cochon again, but try to go on a slower night.

I was ready to get on stage and dance with the v. hot, bearded, tattooed dancer (tons of eye candy aplenty: and OMG I just got the name of the place, holy shit).\n\nThe space/cooling system is the next bonus of iCandy.  THREE whole floors that don't feel jam-packed at all, much like those tight rowhome bars akin to Raven Lounge.  Very spacious and COOL.  I can't stress how important that is.  Don't get me wrong, I was still uber sweaty, but that was only from dancing all night in squat form and in heels (why I did that, I'll never know....#thighgameonpoint, #bootygains).\n\nThe first floor is standard and chill with TVs and seating, for mingling and warming up for the night.  The second floor is out of left field like WOAH ($5 cover-totally worth it BTW) with go-go dancers and strobe lights and that amazing music and a couple fully-stocked bars with super attentive/shirtless bartenders.  And the third floor is very trendy like some upscale Manhattan jawn, with chandeliers and shot boys who come around with whipped cream-topped strawberry jello shots for a buck (hardly any liquor in them though).  The third floor also has an outdoor deck to sneak away for a bit.\n\nOverall, the welcoming vibe of the staff, the music and the kickass layout made me shake my friend and say, \"We're coming here EVERY weekend!\"  So you can bet I'll be back.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "*sigh* ok I'm about to run this place down a little but I'll leave the short version here. 2.5 star dining experience, not bad but I wouldn't go back.\n\n\nThat being done, let's get into the meat and potatoes of things. My first reaction upon walking into the place was a little unsettling. It was like a scene from a movie, I walked in and conversations stopped as all eyes fell on me. Sadly, race IS a thing and I was immediately aware of the fact that I was on the only dark skinned person in the room. Shook it off like Taylor Swift and waited to be seated....and waited.....and waited. So I finally sat myself thinking 'maybe this is the way things are around here'\n\nA waitress eventually came over to inform me that she'd find my waitress, which I was honestly thankful for. When MY waitress came over I asked for recommendations (having never been there before) she responded with \"How am I supposed to know what you want\" At this point I knew this was destined to be an unpleasant dining experience. REALLY wish I'd got the woman's name for a Cersei Lannister like shamming\n\nI ordered a roast beef and fries and looked around while waiting on my oh so pleasant server to return. The place just gave me the feeling like it didn't know quite what it was. Part performance space, part sports bar, with Christmas lights strung up in March.\n\nThe food came out and it was meh. The roast beef and Tony Luke's or at the 20th and Jackson location is so much better and the fries tasted like they just dumped a bunch of salt on them. My server brought out my bill before asking me if I wanted dessert and seemed quite annoyed that I actually did. The dessert was actually delicious, best thing I had that night. \n\nNot the worse meal I've ever had but no reason to go there if you can find a better option in the area", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "I came to family eyecare associates with a severe eye infection that had resisted all previous treatments from my primary care physician and others.

When Joshua called me back I explained my disappointment and told him I didn't want to pay for the clean and that I would clean myself. I explained that we have a baby and a toddler and we chose to hire someone to avoid the trouble of trying to clean with the kids. Joshua said he could send someone out Saturday to re-clean. I explained we were not happy with the way they cleaned and would rather do it ourselves because we would know the job would get done.

We said no, this isn't Shepards pie, this is a stew of some sort and there isn't any mashed potatoes in it. The manager began to challenge us and literally said I can see potato in there (this was after it was mixed around trying to find potato) and then got extremely defensive and said this is how we do our Shepards pie. We said we aren't going to eat it so please take it back. She said fine I'll bring you out something else - we said no thank you please just take the item off the check.

We sardined ourselves into the bar next to two hipsters making out when a second hostess told us that our table was ready.  We went to one of the tables that had been ready when we entered the room.  Were we set up to buy a $12 cocktail?  I don't know.  WHen our food came it was a complete disappointment.\n\nMy wife had cold chicken pot pie that lacked any chicken and had dough rather than pie crust.  The filler in the pot pie was mostly mashed potatoes.  The presentation rivaled something from an army mess hall.  I ordered the pork chop, but at 7:30pm on a Saturday night between Christmas and New Year's - they had sold out of this. And the Lobster Mac and Cheese (also sold out...at 7:30pm on Saturday night).  I ended up with Tenderloin sliders - basically Arby's on a sweet potato biscuit that was really more of a gut bomb.  Heavy, dry, cold and tasteless.  The fries were good though.  My daughter had the Honey Roasted chicken.  Dry as the Sahara and equally as tasty.  She did enjoy the brussel sprouts though.\n\nThe owner seems quite nice - but this is the second bad experience.  Like so many of the reviewers, I SOOOO wanted this to be good.  I am told that they are on their 4th chef and 4th menu in less than a year.  My advice?  Stay away.  There are better managed restaurants in this area - even if they can't hold a candle to Gray's decor.\n\nAnother $5mm Restaurant Impossible if you ask me.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "A friend wanted to try Reifschneider's oven baked pizza's.

Hehe).\n\nI remember my first experience at Target in Burbank, CA when my older cousin brought my Mom and I there to pick up some stuff while we were on vacay. I had no idea that this store would be so clean, pretty, and relatively inexpensive. I was a kid back then.

I understood what they meant. I kinda feel that way about Trader Joe's too but don't get me started.\n\nAnywho, Target is better than Wal-Mart hands down in terms of shopping experience. But Wal-Mart does seem cheaper and they are my go to for cheap meds and are closer to me). This particular Target has two floors and is bigger than the one on the wank. It has parking in the front and multi-level covered parking in the back (hint, there is parking that is connected to the second floor which is convenient if you want to shop there then watch a movie afterwards in Clearview).\n\nThere is a full size food section although not as much variety as Rouse's. I am happy they have a decent wine selection as well.  \n\nKeep in mind that I can literally go up and down each aisle and just meander around and have a good time. I love how the store is well kept, well-lit, and aisles are big and spacious (unlike Wal-Mart where I try to get in and out ASAP). I also appreciate that Target has big-name designers (read Michael Kors and even Neiman Marcus Wow!) come in and do a Target line. Isaac Mizrahi did great stuff, Mossimo is standard, etc.\n\nI also love the cheap bins up front where I find cute little gifts for my nieces which I spoil bc every time I see them I have a little cheapie gift for them (yes I spoil them. It  what favorite aunties do when they co-babysit!)! They love Hello Kitry, Disney and princess's stuff so it's a win-win situation!\n\nPlus they are open later for holiday hours.

Anyone who has read my reviews knows I like little bits of different food like tapas or sushi so this place really works for me. Solid and even good sushi if you find the pieces and rolls you like. \n\nStaff and ambience: though this isn't a buffet, it is similar to buffet style service. No biggie. You may have one person bring this out and another bring this and that out. Of course this depends on how busy they are. No one is coming to your table reading specials or making big introductions. They are very sweet and courteous always. You will have someone refilling your drinks and picking up your menu without problems. The ambience is clean and cozy. Calm. Not loud. I prefer it to the one on the west side. Soft lighting, wood chairs and tables, modestly decorated with Asian influence. \n\nI would recommend them but only to the realistic about an all you can eat sushi establishment. If you're a sushi snob, this likely is not for you. One of the great things about sushi and the sushi experience is it's always evolving and it is quite varied across the globe as it's adapted to the palate and lifestyle of the culture in which it's made and shared. I think Sushi Club fits in with ours and is relevant given that we do tend to want fast, convenient and affordable.

Their Margherita at first bite I was not crazy about but as I consumed more it , it grew on me a bit and given the price it wasn't a bad deal. My biggest gripe was , it did NOT look anything like the commercial , Yes I know nothing ever does but this was pizza not a magic bullet. The pizza was too thin, and lacking 2 of what makes a margherita , not enough Mozza and Basil, this was a big let down, the sauce overpowered the pizza and was not complimented enough by its 2 friends Mozza and Basil.\n\nWe also ordered a Bianco or White Pizza which was very good and it only $13, it was a great deal.

But I can't give it 5 stars because it sloooooowwww service and disorganized counter puts me a bit off.\n\nI've walked into a Kilwin's a few times, always drawn in by the scent, but usually I walked out because it just seemed so overwhelming. There's almost always a ton of people, the line doesn't really start where you'd expect, and because of that you don't really get a great chance to look at the options in the case until you're already expected to order. The problem is that, at least when I've been there, the majority of the customers are trying to get ice cream. To handle this with a limited staff, they have the line to order start by the ice cream and then work its way over to the registers. But as my boyfriend pointed out, he didn't want ice cream but still would have had to wait through the entire ice cream line just to order a piece of fudge, and that was way too much. There are a lot of flavors of ice cream, and everyone wants to try at least one before they order, so the line is very slow moving. When the ice cream counter is busy like that they really should keep their eyes out for customers that might want to quickly order something from the chocolate/candy case to hurry them through.\n\nBut to me, the ice cream is definitely worth the wait. The ice cream options are delicious, and cones are crunchy and flavorful, and the hot fudge is to die for. Getting a scoop or two here is definitely worth the calories. As for their candies and chocolate, I've only had a few, but I've always been a sucker for Kilwin's fudge. The only reason I don't order it as often as the ice cream is because I know I'll eat the entire huge block of it in one night, and that's pretty hard to justify.\n\nSo yeah, definitely stop in here if your sweet tooth is as crazy as mine, but try somewhere else if you're in a hurry.

At the end of it, it boils down to this: I go to eat at a restaurant because I expect to be served professionally and to eat food I can't make myself. No one is perfect but If you screw up, you need to fix it by making it up to me somehow. Make me feel valued and if you know I've come and eaten at your place numerous times before, bend over backwards to keep me. If you show me you care, I can be forgiving. If you come up with excuses why you can't make me feel special and valued then you don't deserve my business again.

Tonight was my 4th visit, and all 4 have been with Britanny who is a master stylist. I have definite \"brand\" loyalty to Aveda salons and I always thought I was getting top notch service ever since 2010 when I started visiting Aveda salons exclusively, but I've learned Ethos, and Britanny specifically, go way above and beyond!\n\nMy color/cut sessions always begin with a consultation where she takes a good look at how my color held up, if my hair is showing damage from styling, and the health of my scalp. The first two times I saw her she asked me lots of questions about what I wanted, but in the most recent two sessions she's learned what I like and usually has a plan in her mind before I arrive. I put complete trust in her picking my color (tonight she put in highlights and I had no idea what color they were until my hair was dry). I love having a stylist I can trust. I am no expert at knowing what color or cut looks best on me, so I'm happy to leave it up to her. \n\nEthos offers a nice drink selection while you enjoy your services, I enjoy the glass of wine very much. While color is processing I wait at a nice table filled with any magazine you could ever want to read. I've also seen people take laptops on the table, it's very versatile. While my color processes Britanny always books my next appointment. \n\nThe next part is what sets this experience apart from all the rest. Sure, we all love having our hair shampooed and conditioned but it is so much more. She does a mini-facial which I wish I could describe properly but suffice it to say it is incredibly relaxing. There are oils and lotions and warm towels and rose water spritz and so much more. She also does a hand and arm massage using their hand lotion that is my all time favorite. This whole shampoo/condition/mini-facial/mini-massage lasts 20? minutes or more. I lose track of time completely. \n\nUpon arriving back in her chair, she gives one last mini-massage on shoulders and neck. Then it's time for a haircut which she always does quickly and very well. She'll style your hair however you like, or like I always allow - let her surprise you. \n\nIt consistently takes 2 hours for my services and I enjoy the time very much. All the stylists are friendly and I appreciate that Britanny remembers things about me from each visit and asks about things I've told her before. \n\nOtherwise, the salon is great. Everyone is friendly and helpful and they carry a great selection of Aveda products. I like that they have a system set up to text you to remind you of appointments. \n\nOne tip is to park in the garage behind Ethos, it is free but not immediately obvious. I highly recommend this salon, and definitely Britanny. As with any Aveda salon and with my choice of a master stylist, the prices are high, but it is a splurge I'm happy to make because I am always absolutely satisfied with my hair and I get a ton of compliments.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.

After doing a ton of research on how to hire moving companies, I got quotes from three. Suburban was the only company who agreed to do an in-home estimate (meaning the estimated quote was going to be more accurate), and also ended up having the cheapest quote to move our stuff; they also found us a separate mover for our motorcycle for a good price. \n\nMoving out: our move date was two days after a massive blizzard dumped about two feet of snow which really complicated where the truck could park. Our driver figured it out (despite having minimal options) and there were no problems. The team of four navigated a slow elevator and kind of a long walk from apartment door to truck, and moved our entire two bedroom apartment in about four hours - it was impressively fast. One of the guys actually helped us break down our pack-n-play as we were having trouble doing it ourselves.\n\nMoving in: one of the reasons we went with Suburban is they would take just our stuff in one truck and drive straight to Chicago (rather than putting our stuff with a bunch of other people's and giving us a 10-14 day window for arrival). Our driver contacted us, as promised, when he arrived in the area on the evening before our move in date. He arrived early the next day with another team of three guys (so four total), and they moved all our stuff into the house in about 90 minutes. After unpacking everything, we had only 3 small items break (and stuff breaks when you move) and Suburban cut us a check for the $100 replacement value rather than the insured value of $0.60/pound.\n\nCustomer service: this set Suburban apart for me. We changed our date after realizing we had set it out too late, and Patrick worked with us and got it done despite dealing with logistics from the blizzard. Patrick answered my many emails in the days leading up to the move about TV boxes, mattress bags, etc., quickly and politely. Finally, we had a few items that we wanted removed from the apartment (not bringing with us) - when the movers couldn't take them the day of, Patrick showed up before work on the day we were leaving Philly and took them away himself. \n\nOverall, I was super impressed with Suburban, especially after being nervous reading horror stories about moving companies online.

It looks so simple and maybe not too appetizing, but this is so good. The sauce really makes it. I grew up eating this, but it gets hard to find a place that makes the sauce just right. If you dip too much, it might get a little bit too salty, so dip sparingly. \n\nChicken lettuce wraps ($6.95) - a light appetizer for when you're waiting for the rest of your meal to come out. The chicken is marinated very well and I think there are mushrooms mixed into it as well. They give a side of sauce, but you really don't need it. \n\nSalt and pepper chicken wings ($5.95?) - So greasy and delicious. Anything they fry \"salt and pepper\" is automatically amazing. From the pork chops to the oysters. But seriously, it's super greasy. \n\nKorean short ribs - basic Korean short ribs, except they drizzle the sauce onto the ribs. If there isn't any sauce on it, it is a little bit bland. But I doubt you'd have any problems asking for more sauce if needed. It's a little on the sweet side, but I think most Korean short ribs have that flavor to it anyway. \n\nSnow pea leaves saut\u00e9ed w/ garlic - I love garlic and I love snow pea leaves. There's not much else to it. But it's super flavorful and garlicky, if that's what you're into. It's \"seasonal\" but I've never been denied snow pea leaves when I come. \n\nCongee w/ preserved duck eggs - okay, so this isn't my abso fav, but they do it pretty well here.

He came out the next day (on a Saturday), quickly diagnosed that the drain line was blocked and causing condensation to back up into the unit.    He was very friendly, fast, and knowledgable.   He spent an hour or two getting the line cleaned out (vacuuming out the line with repeated applications of a caustic solution (in opposite end of line where he was vacuuming from) to kill out the growth that was blocking the line).    He made sure the line was clean, and that water was flowing fast and clear from the unit before he left.    I was impressed with his thoroughness, and over all very happy with his service.    I didn't have a chance to compare the final costs between companies (I called around for service call costs, but couldn't compare the total costs from each vendor, as I didn't know what was needed before John diagnosed it), but overall I'm guessing he was in the ballpark with (if not cheaper than) what others would charge).   My final cost was $140 ($65 service charge - $20 gets applied to the work cost...so really $45), and $95 for the cleaning).   I'm guessing that is inline with other companies.

I thought there would be medium shrimp throughout but the shrimp were on the extra large size and succulent to say the least. It was full of flavor and I enjoyed.

I first discovered Trader Joe's in Las Vegas while visiting my mom and have been a fan ever since.  They have unique products that are under their brand so it's reasonably priced too.  Let's talk about my last visit.. just last week.  I had to be in S. Tampa for an appointment so after, I stopped by.  Parking wasn't an issue on a weekday around 4pm.  But I do know the place gets packed on the weekends.  I was immediately drawn to a display at the front of the store with pumpkin tortilla chips.  I was aweing over them when a kind elderly woman customer told me \"You know, they'll open a bag for you to try it\".  I said, \"they will?!!\"  We called over a manager and she said, \"Yes, they do that.. but they are sampling it now along with the fall harvest salsa\".  My new friend and I immediately made our way to the sampling area.  I tasted the pumpkin chip on its own and then with the Fall Harvest salsa.  It was so yummy, I put one of each in my cart.  I then made my way to the glorious cheese section.  You HAVE to try the Trader Joe's brands carmelized onion cheddar cheese!  It is delicious!  It's great on a burger melted, in grilled cheese (I always used multiple cheeses for that), even just sliced on a cracker or buy itself.  So a block of that went into the cart.  Then I went over to the nut mixes aisle.  There I found a mix of cashews, macadamia nuts, cranberries and pineapple for $6.49, which I thought was reasonable.  Then I went and got some Pink Lemonade also made my TJ.  I chose the low calorie version which has some cane sugar and then some stevia.  It's really good and I like to add some to my iced tea.  I then went to check out the sparkling wines because I find all their wines to be reasonably priced.  I found an Almond flavored one.  I had it Saturday night with a friend and it's very good and I believe it was under $7.  I also picked out a 2nd bottle, a prosecco, that I haven't tried yet.  I also found some stir fry veggies, broccoli and chicken potstickers in the frozen section that I used for stir fry night.  My total bill was about $36.

I suggested that they take it on on the interstate where the problem should be obvious to anyone (High RPMs at 60 MPH isn't \"Fine\").

His wife called and made reservations for the outdoor patio and everything was confirmed. When we all arrived, to our surprise S&V's triple booked the patio when they only had room for one of the groups. They assured us they would make it right and setup tables in the courtyard of the complex for us to dine. \n\nFor over 35+ min our group hung out by the bar ordering drinks to occupy our time. Let me make this clear, it was not the bartenders fault, but a fault in management and training. The bartender was doing her best, but she clearly did not have a lot of bar experience and additionally she had zero help. She was in dire need of a bar back, a second bartender, both of which were unavailable to her. Additionally, she did not know the restaurants mixed drink menu. On multiple occasions when specific cocktails were ordered, what was given to the recipient was not what was ordered and she was very stressed and made very apparent. The bartender went on to continue to apologize because they only had 2 martini glasses within the entire restaurant. To take a step back, they had 3 large parties of 15+, most of their house cocktails require a martini glass and they only have 2 in the restaurant? Again, very poor management. \n\nAfter looking around and no one came to advise us of the tables being setup and ready, we peered out to the courtyard where there was two table setup and we went to them. After about 15min of hanging out at the tables, our server Kyle came out. I will begin with that this was not Kyle's fault. I will give him a lot of credit, he was really working hard. But management in their brilliance decided to make Kyle the server over our group as well as another one of the TOP's on the patio. In doing so, ordering a round of drinks took 20+ min to get them and lead to frustrations all around. \n\nThe night continued as expected. Very slow service (again, not his fault), compounded with one person in my party not even receiving their entr\u00e9e. After continued delays, they eventually asked for them to just cancel the order because after 45min into dinner service when everyone received their meals and they did not, it was just time to give up.\n \nThere were several other concerns including them offering our party a discount on our meals due to the compounded problems but they even forgot to place this on the checks.

I started with the Crab Rangoon and Mon Tod (spicy fish cake).  The Crab Rangoon was mostly air, with about a quarter tsp of cream cheese.  There was not a hint of crab in there anywhere.  The Mon Tod was the only thing I enjoyed about the meal.  I ordered the Panang Curry, but wasn't asked how (if any) spicy I wanted it.  I didn't think about it until the food arrived.  The curry gravy was very thin, almost watery, and lukewarm.  It came with chicken and an assortment of vegetables, which ranged from lukewarm to warm.  The kicker that made this dish the worst Panang Curry I've ever had was the seasoning.  I didn't even know a curry could be make bland.  I guess because I'm \"Farang\" they assumed I don't like spicy.  They should have asked, because I always order Thai Hot!  I like my food spicy.  This Panang Curry had zero.\n\nThe service was okay.  Just a few small things like not asking the level of spice, asking for things multiple times, etc.  The dining area was clean, and the atmosphere made me want to like this place.  Unfortunately, the food just wasn't up to par.  Due to the lacking quality food, low caliber staff, and overly priced menu, I don't see any reason to come back to this establishment.\n\nAnother bummer:  They have two frog leg dishes on the menu.  We were there about 6:00pm on Saturday night, but they said they were out of frog legs.  This is a planning issue.  If it's not popular, take it off the menu, because all you're doing is serving up a big dish of disappointment.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Best Mexican food in Catalina area Very friendly staff \nNice and clean Very well presented meat case \nIf you want genuine this is the place", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Not happy with my experience there's very slow and a few women had attitudes I could also hear yelling from the back.

HORRIBLE experience, NEVER again....THE SERVICE AND THE FOOD WERE TERRIBLE!  (sorry for the longest review ever!)\n\nI'm presently staying at a hotel near Long River (better fitting name would be Long DELIVER!), and asked the concierge for local Chinese delivery menus.  He provide a few, and I KNEW I should have chosen Asia on the Parkway, however I opted for Long River b/c they had a 'diet menu'.  I called to place my order, and spoke with someone who was apparently the 'manager'.  After asking a few very simple questions which weren't really answered clearly (what vegetables are in the mixed veggie blend?  can I get garlic sauce on the side?), I attempted to place my order.  I ordered the following:\n\nsteamed chicken and mixed veggies, garlic sauce on the side, brown rice\nsteamed shrimp and mixed veggies, garlic sauce on the side, brown rice\nsmall hot and sour soup\nsmall tofu and chinese veggie soup\nplates, yellow mustard, soy sauce, forks and spoons\n\nThe woman on the phone kept talking to someone in the background while I was trying to order, and there were children screaming.  I quickly realized that my order was not likely going to be correct, as she could not repeat my order when asked.  My friend who was sitting next to me commented 'I have no idea what is actually going to be delivered'....that's how confused I must have seemed during the call.  She gave me a cost, $32, and hung up.  No time estimate for delivery.  \n\nAbout 40 minutes later, the food was delivered.  We were not given a receipt when we went to the lobby to pick up the food.  When we came back upstairs, we looked in the bag, which contained the following:\n\nsteamed chicken and mixed veggies, some kind of light sauce on the side, white rice\nsteamed shrimp and mixed veggies, some kind of light sauce on the side, white rice\nsmall hot and sour soup\ntofu and mixed veggie entree with brown rice\nplates, yellow mustard, soy sauce, forks\n\nNO tofu soup, extra entree, NO spoons (apparently we were to lap the soup up with our tongues?  Or eat it with a fork?  This is a hotel....I mean, really???)\n\nI didn't think it was a huge issue, and promptly called and explained the mix up - note, we were charged for an entree, not for the soup, which was $5 more., also not a big deal, at the time.  The 'manager' answered the phone again and told me to 'keep the tofu and veggie entree', and she would send the soup.  40 minutes later, AFTER WE HAD FINISHED EATING, the delivery guy came with the soup.  I went down to the lobby to pick up the soup, having thrown away the rest of the food we didn't eat - Chinese food in a hotel is a bad plan, leaving it longer than needed - worse plan ever....  The delivery guy would not give me the soup.  He said he needed to 'exchange' the tofu entree for the soup.  i explained to him that we had tossed the food we didn't eat b/c it wasn't what we ordered and the manager told me to keep it.  We didn't WANT tofu and mixed veggies or we would have ORDERED that.  He tried to argue with me.  In the lobby.  I was in my pajamas.  Really?  I've never had someone try to EXCHANGE a wrong delivery order, especially 1 hour 45 min AFTER THE ORDER WAS PLACED.  He subsequently called the 'manager', who told me that she needed the other food back or $4 for the soup.  I told her that as per her previous direction, I had 'kept' the food and THREW IT OUT b/c we didn't want it.  She hung up on me and the delivery guy threw the soup at me and walked out.  So, I had soup....and they still owed me $5.  \n\nI went back up to my room and called again, speaking to my new friend, the 'manager', yet again.  She told me that she needed the food back to give me my money back.  At that time, we had finished eating....I didn't even WANT the soup anymore, and told her to come get her soup and her entree and bring me the $8 that I was charged for something I didn't want.  She was having none of that and would not listen to reason, nor would she return my money.  At that point, I was just getting frustrated, and decided that their crappy food and the $8 was not worth the throbbing headache I have now....So I said forget it.\n\nDo NOT eat at this place.

Sure, all of the art curated by Conrad Brenner @ Streets Dept is awesome, the highlight of the brand new space, but seeing as they're not permanent installations is a real bummer. Most of the store fronts are filled with \"coming soon\" banners and the place feels eerie and cold. \n\nThe only thing I really think that the Fashion District has done right is that it's left ample room for traveling art installations like Candytopia. I saw an add wall while wandering around upstairs for a new infinity room type installation that will open in January after Candytopia's exit, which should be pretty sweet. Rotating installations like that will definitely keep people visiting to the otherwise unimpressive mall (it's pretty don't get me wrong, but who need another shopping mall). Also the movie theater will be a good addition seeing as I cannot think of a movie theater in that area. \n\nI just worry that with it's close proximity to the Jefferson Station that the people who inherit the depths of the subway will expand into the malls square footage and ruin this as well. Maybe we should've spent the money on helping the homeless versus flashy new mall that no one really needed, but that's just me. \n\nOverall, it's pretty for now, but a flaunt of money if you ask me.

I highly recommend getting whatever house made jam they offer with your baked yums.

However, the method of preparation made the dish difficult to eat. The traditional way of making poutine is cheese on bottom, fries on top and sauce poured. The cheese is cut small so it will melt. The cheese was cut too large and placed on top--this made it hard to eat and there was not enough sauce to melt the cheese.  I would not have it again in this manner.\n  The sliders however, were amazing--the meat was incredible, the bun perfection and the bacon perfect.  I highly recommend.\n   When I mentioned the poutine \"issues\" my server was not gracious--but rather defensive and looked at me like I was an idiot.

Lastly, the pad bed was super spicy, I ordered a 'Thai 10' and they didn't disappoint! Moreover, the vegetable were fresh.

Embedded into a strip mall, the inside has a more upscale, swanky feel to it (but not toooo swanky). Diners can eat at one of the many tables, or dine at the sushi bar. It's always super crowded on a weekend night. \n\nOn my last trip to Bluefin, here's some of what was ordered: \n\nSPICY TUNA SUNDAE // At our table of 8, 7 spicy tuna sundaes were ordered (and one in our party doesn't eat sushi). That's how good it is - it is everyone's favorite. A martini glass is layered with slices of fresh avocado, strips of fresh from the sea ahi tuna, a large serving of roe for pops of flavor in each bite, drizzles of spicy mayo, and a few crushed nuts for the perfect crunch. It's one of those dishes that makes you lick around the glass when you're finished. \n\nSALMON SUSHI // I'm a salmon lover, so I always love to sample it at different places. This one was phenomenal.  The sumptuous pieces of salmon were buttery & just fell apart when they hit your mouth. The best I've had in a while. \n\nALASKA ROLL // A 6-piece roll with that luxurious salmon and fresh & creamy avocado. With such a simple roll, it's important that the ingredients are on point, and this did not disappoint. \n\nSASHIMI PLATTER // The platter comes with 5-6 types of the fresh fish. My dad orders it every time and always loves it. The fish is always of the highest quality. \n\nCHICKEN TERIYAKI // Different than your typical chicky ter, this is served as a whole chicken breast in a balsamic teriyaki dressing, on top of seasonal vegetables. I didn't get to try the chicken, but my cousin (who is picky eater!) really enjoyed it. The seasonal vegetables - in this case, cauliflower/broccoli + chinese broccoli - were well seasoned and tasty in the sauce. It's also served with miso lobster mac & cheese, and I don't even need to explain what makes that good. \n\nThe rest of the group ordered various sushi, sashimi, and rolls, and everyone highly enjoyed their meals!\n\nAt the end of the meal, a lite dessert is brought for each diner - a piece of melon + and a piece of tempura fried banana drizzled in a honey sauce. The melon is always sweet, and the bananas are next level. The banana is soft on the inside, and the outer tempura layer gives a sweet crunch. Beware, they're hot!\n\nWill I be back? Yes.

But I just can't with them anymore. \n\nThe first issue I have is that it's all gimmick and no substance. Case in point, the first time I had Subzero (on Mass Ave shortly after they opened) was back when they had a non-soy, non-dairy base option (I can't remember whether it was almond or coconut milk because I like both, but it was one of the two). That was great. Yet the one in Carmel has never had that as an option, which sucks for those with dietary restrictions or specifications that would allow for this kind of treat with either of those choices. Another thing is that the syrups they use are gross. We had a raspberry chocolate with choc chip mix-in. The raspberry syrup bordered on disgusting, tasting nothing like raspberries and reminding me of how fake cherry can taste like cough medicine--only worse. Like straight-up chemicals in a bowl. \n\nSecond major issue is the service in Carmel. It's like a lot of places in the Arts & Design. You get these snotty teenagers who look at you like you have three heads. My 14-yr-old and I wanted the same exact thing, I wanted a little and I knew he would eat more than a lot. So rather than ordering a small and a regular, I asked for a large and an extra (paper) bowl. I was questioned about it, twice down the line and once again at the register and given all manner of stink eye. \"You know what MacKenzie or Tiffany or Mercedes or whatever your names are, just make my flipping order and stop with the judgement.\" And that's not the first time the service has bordered on obnoxious.\n\nNeedless to say, after giving this joint more than a fair shake, with having gone there a handful of times, I won't be back.

I am the first to admit that fuzzy old Max is a horrible patient, and I've made it a habit of warning vets and techs to take everything slow and gentle so as not to activate Psycho Kitty. Everyone I've met at VCA has been very respectful of Max and kept him from entering panic mode, and that counts for a lot in my book. Dr. Simpson is also always very honest and forthright about different options - Max is hyperthyroid, so we talk about pills vs. radiation treatment frequently - and while she's happy to make recommendations, she never tries to convince me to try some particular brand, or to switch Max to a food I can only buy there, or in any other way give me a hard sell on a particular decision. I always come away with the feeling that she genuinely cares about Max and his well-being.\n\nMaybe I've just always gone to pricier vets without knowing it, but I don't think there's anything shocking about the prices VCA charges. My bills seem in line with the prices I was used to paying in Chicago. Plus, every time I've had Max in for an exam, Dr. Simpson has given me an itemized bill to review before giving him any additional procedures, and she always gives me the chance to say no to any- or everything before she does anything beyond the standard checkup.

Have a very serious gluten allergy (Celiac) and thought with \"gfree\" written everywhere on this menu that we would be able to eat great sushi here. In good sushi restaurants, you just have to avoid items with soy sauce since soy sauce is derived from wheat. You also have to accept that there is always a risk of cross contamination when you eat out in any restaurant -this is a fact of life when you have a gluten intolerance or Celiac. That said, sushi rolls come down to rice and fish so they should be safe since both ingredients are inherently gluten free. \n\nMassive disappointment at Azie. Their version of gfree sushi is to make sushi with nasty brown rice. Apparently, the rice vinegar they use to bind the white rice together in the regular sushi contains wheat. Using these lower quality rice vinegars that contain gluten is cheaper and easier for restaurants like Azie.\n\nAzie management, I applaud your effort to offer gluten free menu items so thank you for that. I also appreciate that you are up front that the regular sushi is unsafe for those with gluten issues.

Tip: Ask for the sauce on the side so the flavor isn't too overwhelming.\n\nThe Ringer Burger: Comes with bacon as well as onion rings, which make for a nice and crunchy burger. Tip: Ask for the onion rings on the side to preserve crunchiness.\n\nThe Zinburger: Perfect, especially with the braised onions.

It's sort of a hipster/modern verison of a taco place. Great for casual settings, night out for drinks. The staffs were really nice, they provided excellent service.\n\nFOODFORTHOUGHT: The tacos are pricy in comparison to what we usually pay for in New York. It's about $13-15 for three tacos and you can't mix and match you have to get a couple of the sets and swap it with your friends. We ordered the Fried Mahi Mahi taco, grilled skirt steak taco, Nachos and Ceviche. The tacos were mediocre, felt like it was missing something. The Nachos were good, if they had more sauce on top would have tasted really good. The Ceviche was a little to oily. They don't give you salsa so you need to order that if you want to add it onto your tacos. \n\nOverall, Mission Taqueria isn't a place for authentic tacos.

Not once did the waitress come and ask us if we needed anything or give us updates on our orders.  My sister had to go into the restaurant to get the menus because she didn't bring them to us.  She forgot two items that we ordered and brought my brother the wrong drink.  We actually had to go inside to ask what was taking our order so long after waiting almost an hour.  The waitress said she just submitted our order to the kitchen 10 minutes ago (when we've been there for 50 minutes) and told us we came a couple of minutes before the restaurant opened, so that's why she had to serve other people first.  Does that make any sense at all????  So basically she couldn't serve us first because we had made reservations.  She had to serve the others who did not make reservations.  We asked if we could have our salads at least and she said she would check on the order.  But then another waiter said that the salads have been just sitting there at the counter for a while now. Instead of bringing us our salads right away, she had someone else do it.  She never apologized or showed empathy.

Agree or disagree, your replies are valued.\n\nPlease allow me to preface this review with 2 comments:\n1) The ambiance and feel of Bella Luna, was for me, awkward and more than a little bit dated.\n2) It pains me to give any restaurant with heart a negative review. Their hearts are in the right place, the food and service? Not so much on the night we visited.\n\nIt was a Friday, and we met the in-laws for a birthday celebration.  We had reservations for 7pm and it was a \"dark and stormy evening\" in Tucson (not something we get to say very often).\n\nWe arrived on time and had taken a moment in the car to read some of the evenings' specials on-line.  My better half commented on the special menu seeming a bit heavy. Little did she know how prophetic that observation would turn out to be. I don't know if any of you recall Pee Wee Herman's Saturday morning kids show with the secret word?  Every time someone said the secret word of the day, everyone screamed and the secret word would drop from the ceiling dangling on a piece of string. The secret word for this restaurant:  HEAVY.\n\nWe walked into what I can only describe now as one of those awful Vegas-styled Holiday Inn lounge act duos performing in the bar area. You know the kind,  he plays an electronic keyboard that doubles as a karaoke machine and she sings along.  I asked to be seated as far away as possible.  I want to be clear here.  Put him at a real piano and her singing some jazz standards with an occasional cool cover song and drop the quasi Karaoke  and I would have loved them.  They did not suck; their show did.\n\nOne other issue I had on arrival.  When I place a reservation at your fine dining establishment, I like for you to not be apparently stunned when I actually show up. I wasn't sure if it was that they were stunned I personally showed up, or if it was they are generally stunned when anyone shows up for a reservation.  We stood for fifteen minutes while the hostess scrambled to turn a table for four into a table for four and then sat the five of us at it.\n\nThe Service?\nA clearly overwhelmed, under-trained and under-supported staff did their very best to accommodate us.  I'd like to also say that our waitress deserved the 20% she received.\n\nSome hints for Bella Luna Owners and managers:\nAsking about getting a table drinks at a fine dining establishment without having provided the table with your wine list in advance is an amateur mistake and is indicative of a lack of training and support. It's really stupid to not give me a list of things for me to spend money on.  In most restaurants those are called the main, wine, and dessert menus.\n\nNot having enough staff to help out or even wait on your reserved tables means you aren't in the game to win.  You failed your staff miserably and if I were them, I would ditch you.\n\nOne of the ways to placate customers that are waiting too long for a table is to ask them to please have a seat at the bar while you \"make arrangements\".  It takes the heat off of you and us, plus I am a lot more fun, generous, and hungry after a couple of drinks.  Since you had no bartender behind the bar I think it might also be the reason you have no patrons at your bar.  Zip, nadda, not a soul at the bar.  Again, my experience in the hospitality industry  tells me that bars are only effective at generating income when you have a bartender standing there ready to take an order and then the cash.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of alcohol. When you bring wine to the table, there is no excuse for not  having \"red wine\" glasses available.  Of course, on a camping trip I will drink wine straight from the bottle, but we weren't on a camping trip, were we?\n\nNow lets discuss two more things that should never occur in a dining establishment that wants to get more than $20 per plate.\n\n1) It is not OK to seat one table so close to another that your wait staff has to yell at us to be heard and has to do a complicated contortionist act in order to be able to place items on the table.\n\n2) When it comes time to serve dessert it is not OK to plunk down a handful of silverware in the middle of the table for us to scrap over and then scurry off.\n\nOn this night, management was entirely missing.  No one in charge was marshaling or supporting anyone.\n\nI had the rest of this posted at my website and Yelp made me take down the link, sorry.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "This place was absolutely great, my brother used to work for them back when they were Caf\u00e9 Brazil maybe 15 years ago.

I called again, stopped by again and again, and finally \"Manny\" called and left me a message.

The fish comes with a kalamata lemon butter sauce which I mentioned to the waiter might be a deal breaker for me since I am not an olive fan.  He offered to substitute a sauce or put it on the side.  I wanted to taste the flavor combo, so I went with having it on the side.  So glad I did!  The sauce had a tasty blend of flavors which didn't overwhelm the fish with the olive taste.  Sometimes you just have to trust the chef!  The halibut was gleaming white inside and very moist and tender while the top had a golden sear.

The service was prompt, but not overbearing. We ordered the famous sweet tea everyone was raving about and they were right! So delicious! We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the seasoned steak fries. The meat was mouth-watering, the bread tasted very fresh to me, and the cole slaw was very fresh and crunchy. We got the sauce on the side so that we could easily dip the sandwich. I really enjoyed the different sauces. Variety is good! The fries were really crispy and perfectly fried, the seasoning was very tasty...I don't know what's in it, but I heard it's a secret so shhh!\n\nThe second time I visited Rosey's it was a different story...it was BETTER! Haha! I tried the famous ribs this time and they were AWESOME!! I brought them over to a friend's house and they were an immediate hit! My friend was like, \"Where the heck did you get these ribs from?!?\" I even had some leftover that I brought for my co-worker and he was in heaven! \n\nThe last time I was in I got the ribs again, but I got to try the other sides. Boy am I glad I did! The baked beans are to die for! I will bet money that you have never had better baked beans in your life - they were literally mouth-watering! They were sweet and tangy with a little kick - just how I like 'em! I love the pieces of succulent pork mixed in with the beans! Their mac-n-cheese is crazy good as well! The only issue I had was with the greens (maybe that's because I don't really like them in general! lol), to me they are just a bit bland and bitter, but that's probably how they are supposed to taste. Maybe if I liked greens I would say they are incredible! I read from other reviews that they use turkey instead of pork in the greens, it probably tastes better with the pork. My friend got this really good salad (why order a salad at a BBQ place??) with smoked turkey on it, it looked dry for some reason, but when I tasted a piece it was delicious and surprisingly juicy...weird. \n\nAnyway, suffice it to say that I took a box home with me!

The restaurant has a wonderful laid-back romantic vibe, with dim lighting and an underground wine cellar type of vibe. I had arrived about 20 minutes after my group arrived; upon arrival, the waiter totally disregarded my presence and did not offer a chair, silverware, nor water. After a few minutes of standing around, I decided to just pull up a chair from another table and join the group. When I sat down he still never asked me what I wanted to order, so my friend ended up getting up and approaching him to tell him that I would like to order.  He took my order, but still did not give me silverware, a cup for the water, nor asked me what I wanted to drink. I felt the service was not up to par and feel that they do need some type of training or new waiters, to make it a better experience for people attending the restaurant. I was very excited about eating authentic Italian food for a fews weeks now, so I searched the menu for a pasta dish. The dish I originally wanted was the Tortellini, but the waiter said there was none left. I then ordered a pork ragu pasta, which I asked the waiter for a description of, since I didn't know what it was exactly. Upon his explanation, he never mentioned that the dish had a kick to it. I wish he would've mentioned that it was spicy, because I am very sensitive to spicy food, and usually Italian pasta does not have such a spicy kick to it. When my food arrived, it was actually given to someone else in my table, under the title of his plate, so my friend started eating my dish without either one of us knowing that it was my dish, because it was titled as his. When my waiter came, he informed us that that was actually not his plate. So they took the plate away and brought me another one, when I tried it, I thought it was very spicy to tolerate, so I ate less than half of it because I was starving and decided to take the rest home, to try to eat it at another time. My friend then received his actual plate, he too felt it was extremely spicy as well, his was actually a lot more spicy. He ended up doing the same, not being able to get through half of his plate, due to the spice level in his dish. On the upside, the pasta was freshly made and did taste fresh and I'm sure the pasta would've been delicious, had it not been spicy. I ordered the cannoli for dessert, that was delicious. I ate every bit of it. The cheese relieved alot of the spicy sensation in my mouth. I got to try the chicken dinner that another friend ordered, and that was amazing!

I wanted to go to an art film coincidentally about a German allegedly a Nazi German in rural Americana during the 1940s. I was asked about wearing a mask when I approached the theater by an employee but when I told him that I always wear my face shield he let me go in the theater and within about 20 minutes of when the film started this woman comes in and said I had to wear a mask over my nose and I said this is it and then I tried to wear this other mask that I have that I still can't wear  over my nose plus I have to drink a lot of water for a medical condition so she asked me to stop drinking the water. She came in there a total of three times and told me to stop drinking the water unless I wanted to buy some outside or come out in the lobby and drink it. Plus she said that I had to wear a face mask due to government regulations and I told her that is not what Tom Wolfe says and I have been all over Philadelphia and I have not had this problem before particularly when there were only three other people in the space.

I arrived early on a Sunday evening, and when I walked in, the hostess didn't even acknowledge me, in spite of the fact there was nobody else around and she was just standing there. So, as I slowly walked past her, I said hi and got a forced \"hi\" back.  I proceeded to sit at the empty bar--there was one other person a few seats down.  Bartender simply just looked at me when I sat down--didn't say hello, or anything until finally he asked me if I wanted a drink.  So, I ordered a beer and an entree.  Oh, I also enjoy the fresh bread before my meal.... but never got any, was never offered any.  My meal came out pretty quick (like I said, not many people there) so I guess I didn't really need the bread.  My expensive beer--yes, $7 for a 12 oz draft is expensive, was empty for awhile before the bartender decided to ask me on one of his pass-byes if I would like another.  Anyhow, I had a CL coupon, so it ended up being a good value, but if I was paying full price, the service would certainly not have matched the price level.  Coincidentally, the service was sub-par before the bartender was aware I had a coupon.... if the bartender, Christopher, is new, he needs some/more customer service training... if he's not new, well, same scenario.

May I add we made a reservation two weeks in advance, due it being a Friday night on top of Valentines being just two days ago. We got there right on time, 7:30, and the waitress asked us to wait just 5 minutes because the people at our table were just finishing dessert. There were three available booths at the time we walked in and no reserved signs on the tables. We kindly waited outside and shortly after, another couple walked in who said they had reservations and got seated right away. One table out of the three open ones were taken now. Then another couple walks in and stated they did not have reservations but wouldn't mind waiting at the bar until the next available table. A different waiter was helping them that helped us and he said oh no there's a booth right here for you and they got seated right away. At this point my boyfriend is very pissed off that 2 tables have been seated before us, one not even having reservations and we are still waiting. He went to tell to the waitress that helped us when we walked in that we were cancelling our reservation due to the fact that a couple was just seated without a reservation right away and that obviously our two week hold for a reservation doesn't matter, all she had to say was, \"no that's not possible they had to of had a reservation\" he explained to her how they said they did not have one and all she could say was I'm so sorry and didn't even offer us the last table that was still available or maybe a different table that had opened up through out this whole chaos.

Not a huge deal. This place looks well kept and for the most part staff is friendly. Now here is why I did not give this hotel a 5 star... day 1 was great now day 2 was a whole different story. My fianc\u00e9 & I decided to check out lex night club which is located inside of the hotel, upon arrival there was no line so we walked up to the gentleman who was standing there who failed to even crack a smile.

The dj played all the good songs and this is why we stayed for 2 hours just having drinks and relaxing. Now fast forward to bed time, my fianc\u00e9 wakes up to go use the restroom & the floor is completely filled with water, when i say filled i mean FILLED AND LEAKED TO THE FLOORS BELOW US! The toilet was overflowing & must have overflowed for at least an hour prior to us finding out, nothing gross was coming out but it's still disgusting toilet water all over the room at 430 am! We did get the toilet to stop over flowing and got most of the water on the bathroom floor but the place was soaking . Security knocked on our door shortly after to let us know that the two floors below us are getting hit with the water from our room & that we would need to move rooms. I get it, this had to be fixed ASAP before it causes more damage so of course we agreed. We packed all our things and went down to grab our new room key and to my surprise they put us in a crappy room that was a smoking room. This room reeked! We book a non smoking room (summit king) & they thought it would be ok to down grade us to a smoking room with two full maybe queen size beds that were hard as a rock. Mind you my fianc\u00e9 is 6 foot 7! We came out to Reno to celebrate our anniversary and to sleep in the same bed in a nice room. This is our first outing together in a year since we just had a baby and finally agreed on a sitter. You can see why I'm upset and disappointed right? We ended up in two separate beds on our last night to say the least. The manage that came on the clock shortly after the water incident was more caring and professional with her words unlike the other girls in the front desk. The manager let me know that she was going to try and get the second night comped but ended up only taking off 50 bucks . In my opinion I feel like we deserved to be comped in full for the inconvenience. Just to clarify we changed rooms twice, the first room was the smelly smoking room and the second one was a standard non smoking but had to small beds which is the one we ended up in because we were exhausted and had no energy to go back and forth about how we felt. All in all I felt like if they couldn't upgrade us to a better room or one equivalent for what we paid for then they should have comped us a room or gave us our money back for the night so we can go get a room we actually want to sleep in at a different hotel.

Bamboo was sweet, weirded me out and I didn't think it went well with the broth. And the mushrooms they used were normal mushrooms instead of the kikurage mushrooms which I think would have provided better texture.  Not mad about the fact that they gave two types of meat though: beef and the typical pork charshu. The beef slices were the exact kind my dad uses in pho though, so I thought that was weird to find in ramen. It was tender though. Pork was mostly meat and less fat - I typically see ones that are more fat but I don't mind. It was seasoned properly and tender. Oh yea, and noodles were too soft imo, but I have yet to find a place that cares about how firm you like your noodles haha.  But the two narutos given to you were nice and firm! Chewy!

Since they were out of pork rinds, I've ordered some salsa, and asked for cellery sticks and broccoli or cauliflower do dip into my salsa. She brings me carrot sticks. Ugh. She did bring me more cellery sticks after I've told her I don't want the carrots though. Ive ended up ordering a bunless burger with a side salad. Of course I was charged extra since the burger comes with fries that I didn't want, then they had croutons all over my salad when it came out.

Everyone has their own opinions on what certain things should taste like and how meats should be prepared and cooked. Personally, I don't care as long as it tastes good. \n\nI walked in here for lunch around opening time to avoid a huge lunch rush. I took a look at the menu, decided on my order and walked up to the counter. A nice gentleman asked me if this was my first time here, told me I would really like the food and that it was \"good shit.\" \n\nThat's an interesting term to use to describe your food, but I'll make that decision. He explained the BBQ sauce bar to me and sent me on my way. \n\nI grabbed a booth near a TV and waited for my food that came out just minutes later. I went over to the BBQ sauce bar and got one of each of the four options they had displayed. They offer two Carolina style of sauces, one sweet, and one hot. Unfortunately, the sauces weren't very good and that was disappointing. One of the Carolina sauces had a very heavy mustard taste and the other one had too much of a vinegar taste. Sure, that's Carolina style, but it was a flavor overkill. They should have combined the two sauces and maybe they would have had the right sauce. I wasn't a fan. I moved on to the hot BBQ sauce and nothing about it was hot. There was no heat to it and nothing about it to make it remotely hot. There wasn't much taste to it, which left me with one more to try- the sweet sauce. That also had no flavor to it and nothing about it was sweet. I ended up not liking any of their sauces, but I settled with the sweet sauce because it tasted just like plain BBQ sauce. I can't recall any BBQ place that struck out more on sauces than this one. That was really disappointing. \n\nOnto the food part. I ordered the brisket sandwich with fries and mac and cheese. All of it was average at best and that is the best way I can put it. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, it just got the job done. The brisket was very tender but very bland. The only seasoning I could taste on it was pepper and it was just very bland. The fries were nothing to rave about and some of them were soggy. The mac and cheese wasn't anything special and it tasted right out of a box. Get creative and at least throw some breadcrumbs on top or add some sort unique twist to it to call your own.\n\n As I was eating, I kept thinking of a way to describe the food and all I that I could come up with is just average. The portions were nice for the price points and that was one of the few positives to this visit. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor inside was very nice and they really put some thought into designing the restaurant. It has the Ford's Garage mixed with a roadhouse sort of feel. The booths were very uncomfortable and need some sort of cushion on them. They were very hard to sit on and I was somewhat sore when I got up.  If you're tall, I don't recommend sitting in a booth.

There is a universal belief in the principle of YING and YANG accepted by philosophy, physics, biology (including our own bodies!) and certain Eastern religions. In the restaurant industry this concept reduces to PRODUCT and SERVICE. So it must apply to this LONG ESTABLISHED destination in Chestnut Hill. And when I say this place has done stratospheric scale business CONSISTENTLY over decades, I'm not exaggerating. The key word in this review is CONSISTENT. The attractive physical setting, the menu and quality of food and its preparation: CONSISTENT. Why change something if there is no need. You will NEVER EVER have to worry facing a major change here--of course, all pandemic related are excluded. Now we reach the YANG: service. The experience of truly superior food can be nullified by lackluster service. It's as basic as YING AND YANG. I exclude the surfeit of never ending smiles, bows and small talk. That's NOT true service-- it's acting! In my personal experience, a MINOR concern here is likely met with a FIRM self justification; a relatively minor request may be honored reluctantly or declined. You RISK ending up telling yourself: the food is CONSISTENTLY VERY GOOD so DON'T complain, and try NOT to request\". Which is the place I'm at NOW as I write this and it is NOT the role any customer should end up playing. CIN CIN considers itself high end for the area but there are 5 star and Michelin rated restaurants who are as meticulous about the quality of their service as what leaves their kitchen; they demand and deliver on EQUALITY of both. In fact they prefer the challenge of satisfying a customer's need even if it's borderline legit or even merit less! Because at that moment, they know that it's how the restaurant responds that distinguishes it from the rest.

The Special Pedicure was a great price and an awesome blend of nail shaping, cuticle treatment, callus removal, exfoliation, lotion, massage, paraffin wax, hot towel for your legs and feet.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "I had a 90-minute treatment: 30-min foot reflexology and 60-min full body massage. Hands down, it was one of the best experiences that I ever have had with massage. The price is only $80 and with the Groupon that I purchased, it was half that. I bought two more Groupons as soon as soon as I got home. After I use these then I will pay full price. It was THAT good. They do offer a free frequent buyer program: After 5 massages your 6th is free!\n\nDon't be off put by their crummy website. The interior of this spa is very nice. \n\nThis was my first experience with Chinese massage. It is different from American massage in that it focuses on stretching, kneading and pushing the muscles and involves pressing acupressure points to relieve stress and pain. The techniques improve blood flow to areas, which facilitates health and gets rid of lactic acid buildup. The techniques also help produce a calm and relaxing mood. I almost fell asleep during my reflexology session.\n\nMy session began with me laying face up on a contoured bed/table. The gentleman doing my treatment placed a hot pillow under my back and my feet in a tub of hot water. He then performed reflexology of my head and ears. That was followed by neck, arms, hands reflexology. Then the beloved feet reflexology. It was heaven. Truly.\n\nWe moved into a mother room for my full body massage. I would say it was a combination of techniques from Chinese or Thai massage, hot stone massage, and deep tissue massage. Just imagine and entire hour of deep tissue massage, hot oil, and hot stones after having a full 30-minutes of reflexology. I did not want it to end. \n\nAccording to LiveStrong.com, \"Ancient Chinese massage holds the belief that energy in the body has to flow continuously to help an individual to relieve stress and prevent diseases. Chinese massage focuses on channels or energy points that will effectively transport and guide blood and energy, or \"qi,\" throughout the body. The aim is to achieve balance to protect the person against different types of infection and maintain the optimum function of all organs. When the channels are impeded or blocked, the person experiences pain and is prone to health problems. The masseuse can identify which pathways are blocked and need pressure. A May 2013 study by the American Massage Therapy Association showed that regular massages can treat different serious illnesses like chronic low-back pain, cardiovascular problems and rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nFoot reflexology may not be good for you if your feet are ticklish. And it is contraindicated in pregnancy as it reportedly can induce labor. Chinese massage may not be enjoyable to you if you like light massage. Also, this type of massage will not be appropriate for you if you are shy about your virtually naked body with a male masseuse. \n\nChinese massage will be a great experience for you if you are comfortable with the ancient art of reflexology. I really enjoyed that my masseuse was able to open up the tightness in my hips and lower back. It felt incredible. I feel like butter.

They wrote it down along with the room number that I was heading to so they could send everything to the room. When we got to the room, we saw that the bed was a full-size bed, not a king bed and we had reserved for the 1-BD suite, so we asked to switch rooms. They switched us into a King bed room, but when we got in there the room was still not made up all the way...the sofa bed was pulled out and there was dust everywhere...it looked like nothing had really been cleaned completely. So, I had asked them to have someone come to clean the room and to have all of our things brought to this room instead. They assured me that it would be taken care of. Three hours later, we come back to the room to drop something off. We came to find that the room was STILL not cleaned up nor were the things in the room that we had asked for. So, I called the front desk to ask why it was still not taken care of 3 hours later. The woman said that she would get someone up there and I said to her that this was unacceptable and that it should have been dealt with 3 hours ago. She then hung up on me as I was talking to her. She HUNG UP ON ME! What kind of service is that? So, I called back. She knew that it was me, so she proceeded to pick up the phone, not answer it, and just hung up. She did this about 4 times. Then I called the operator and asked to speak to a manager because I couldn't believe that she not only hung up on me, but that she continued to hang up on me without answering the phone. So, when we got the manager, Mark, on the phone, I explained to him what had happened and that it was absolutely unacceptable behavior - no matter who the customer is. I specifically asked him if we had to stay in the room to make sure that someone came in or if we could leave. He said, no, you can absolutely leave and it will be taken care of. So, we left. TWO HOURS LATER, I came back to the room and found that it was STILL not cleaned nor had anything been brought up. So, again, I called the front desk. I spoke to Emily, who proceeded to give me attitude because she said that someone would be on their way. This is when I started to record the call. I told her that I was not going to get off the phone with her until I see a cleaning lady come up. She said to me that they would be up in 5 minutes. I told her that I would put on the stop watch and time how long it would take the cleaning lady to get up there, but that I was not getting of the phone with her until they came. Then 12 minutes later, I got a knock from the cleaning lady who did NOT have anything with her except her cart...so, no pillows or mini fridge, just the towels and cleaning supplies. I told Emily that I still did not want to hang up with her until everything was there. Then she hung up on me again. So, I kept calling back and finally got Mark back on the phone. I told him that this was ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE - I even said to him that HE as a MANAGER promised me that I did not have to stay in the room to make sure that things got taken care of and then that HE as a MANAGER should have FOLLOWED-UP with his staff and cleaning crew to ensure that things were taken care of. He basically brushed this off with, \"well, I'm not sure what more that I can do...we have comped your room for the two nights along with breakfast.\" Then he asked me if I would like to move hotels and that he could find me a room. I said, absolutely not, we are here for a wedding, all of our stuff is here! Then I said that I'm still waiting for the mini fridge. He proceeded to tell me they were all out. I said, that I had asked for this 5 HOURS PRIOR and that under no circumstances should I not have one. He then hung up with me saying that he would do his best to find one....I never heard from him again. I have to contribute the night shift cleaning lady to locating a mini fridge....Oh, and not to mention, that when I asked her why she is just now getting to my room, when I had asked for this to be taken care of not only 3 hours prior and then another 2 hours prior, she said that there was a night shift change in the cleaning staff and that she was the ONLY ONE on the night shift!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! For a hotel with over ____ how many ever rooms? I'm going to guess 500? There's 1 NIGHT SHIFT CLEANING LADY?! Again UNACCEPTABLE. I then said, that she really should have someone helping her because this is ridiculous that she is by herself. I asked her where on the list that my room was...she said NUMBER 3 ....NUMBER 3 - from 5 HOURS PRIOR - that's literally how long it took for someone to come to my room. I travel A LOT for work and A LOT in general. I have NEVER EVER been treated the way that I was at your hotel. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. I would 100% steer clear from this hotel.

But after my experience with their arrojo wave perm  service, I was very disappointed. \n\n\nThe long story: I went into consultation with tons of pictures showing exactly the kind of curls/waves/look I was after. They even showed me pictures of their own client's before and after photos of what they could do, I pointed to specific pics of theirs, and we were all set. Marcos was so reassuring, \"Girl, we know what you want.\"  Almost 5 hours and $250 later, I had barely any wave in the front and a very stringy set of uneven waves in the back. I told Gato right away that this WAS NOT what we talked about. He was very reassuring, \"Give it time to settle and keep in touch, we want you 100% satisfied.\" As nice as they were, I cried on my way home and really struggled with doing anything presentable with my hair. Gato and I texted and he was so sweet and comforting!\n\nAs promised, a month later I was rescheduled to come back for consultation with Marcos. I was very taken back by his response to my hair, as he now criticized my own hair for why it didn't work. \"Your hair isn't as thick...this person has a different length....Your hair is porous because you were using bad products...you'll never get what you see in the ads, they use heat...etc.\" I get it, perms are a crapshoot. But to do this type of perm, the stylist needs training and certification. Wouldn't you know some of this ahead time and adjust as required? People with thick and textured hair aren't breaking down the doors for perms. It's the lame Caucasian straight fine hair that we want to add body to. Anyway, I digress.\n\nHe proposed/insisted to try again with tighter rods, \"now that we know what you want.\" Heyyy, I made it very clear what I wanted, the final outcome wasn't what we all originally discussed. At this point, I told him I didn't want to retry because it didn't seem like they could do what they originally promised (based on everything he just told me). I suggested a refund, or partial refund. After all, I spent $250 + 20% tip + $100 on suggested products. He told me that he couldn't offer me anything back until he himself at least tried one more time for free. Reluctantly, I agreed, and this time, it looked almost worse because some sections had tight curls (yay!), but others, not at all.  \n\nI reached out again saying, yup, as I thought, it didn't work out again, what can I do? This time, the response was \"it's out of our hands, the bonds in your hair just don't like to hold curls and there's no way of knowing this. We just wanted to make sure the service was done 100% correctly. You can use a curling iron for some more bounce.\"\n\nWait, what?? What happened to 100% satisfaction?. And yes you did know that my hair is resistant to curls. A) I told you. Which is why I opted for a PERM and B) Because YOU TOLD ME that it's reason for why the first one didn't work, which is why I didn't want to do it again In the first place!\n\nNow I'm left with even worse hair integrity with frizz and no wave which happened after just a couple weeks, $350 gone, and needless waist of time. Gato is one of the nicest people I've met, but I just feel this could have been handled better somehow.\n\nThe short story: After reading the non 5 star reviews and talking to a friend who went there before, this experience seems to be similar: \nWhen bad/unintended results happen, they offer a free redo (while your own hair is criticized for why it didn't work), then if it still isn't right/or what you asked for, they say they did everything right, sorry you don't like it.

I never fired a gun or had any sort of training until I was in the military and I wanted to expose them properly to guns while they were younger so they know the protocol. \n\nI was so impressed I have taken them through twice. The instructors are knowledgeable and have years (I think over a century) of combined training. More than that they spoke with the kids not just at them. Incredible amount of patience and also made sure the parents were comfortable as well. \n\nThere is class time (a couple hours) first. They engage the kids in the lessons and do a wonderful job emphasizing safety. More than that they go over types of guns, what firearms are used for, and more. \n\nYou also get two hours of range time in the \"private party\" or \"executive suite\" range (or something like that, it's the lanes furthest from the public side). The kids get to shoot a rifle (10/22), and a pistol (22lr). For those unaware of what that means it's the caliber of bullet. Really small and quiet. Very little kick.  And on the pistols (most anyway) they have suppressors (silencers). Makes them even quieter. After the first two rounds the kids picked their favorite and did one more round with that. \n\nBottom line is that it was fun and educational. And my kids want to go to the range now they enjoy it.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Came here for lunch with a group of about 6 people.

Light, not too sweet, and addicting, it's hard to stop with just a small. It's especially good in their sundaes, which are made with real fruit. The Tin Roof Sundae is another great choice. Lots of chocolate sauce, peanuts, and whipped cream.\n\nThe hot dogs are pretty basic if you don't know to ask for toppings. There are a number of free toppings (ketchup, mustard, onions, jalapenos) as well as some premium toppings for an additional charge. I haven't tried the sloppy joes or bbq sandwiches, nor have I seen them ordered, so it seems the hot dogs and fries are the way to go.\n\nWhile the overall decor is older, Dice's is really clean and kept that way.

The Aji was light and fresh. And the Unagi had a nice char with ponzu that wasn't too sweet. \n\nThe standards, like salmon, yellowtail and tuna, are all well sized, not too cured and reasonably priced. \n\nWe got the \"Carlos Roll\", with diced spicy tuna, cucumber, asparagus and roe. The components are delicious. But the internal ingredients are wrapped in nori, then covered in rice, so it ends up too big of a bite per piece. And the nori doesn't cut well, so it all falls apart. BUT very tasty. \n\nThe Midiroi Saki Maki roll was very well proportioned (bite sized), with spicy salmon, avocado and chili sauce. Very good. \n\nWe also got some gyoza.

However, I just called Les Schwab for a price comparison basically, but when I found out they were charging the nearly same for lug nuts (with free installation) as the online company I was about to purchase them from - I leaped at the opportunity. \n\nUpon arriving, I was told that the price I was given over the phone was wrong, the actual solid lug nuts I needed were $2.00 cheaper - I was extremely happy. They replaced all the lug nuts in less than 10 minutes for about 1/4 of the quoted dealership price.\n\nMoreover, (women will know what I mean) I wasn't told my brake pads were failing, my so and so needed to be replaced immediately, they did the job I wanted them to do and didn't lie to me to try to get me to do extra work - VERY HAPPY ABOUT THEIR HONESTY! I get so sick of mechanic shops lying to my face about \"needed\" repairs.\n\nLastly, the shop was clean, everyone was very friendly, and professional. I would 110% recommend them.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Great for a late night burger stop. The drinks were strong and reasonably priced.

For the hype though I was pretty surprised with the ambience I really thought it would be more upscale but the vibe is pretty cool although not that cozy. Also, I feel like I would've totally missed it if I was just walking by and not looking for it. Maybe that's just me though, who knows... Overall I really like the concept of it, plus you can't beat a restaurant that serves everything fresh!\n\nAnyways, on to the food! I really liked everything that I tried. The American burger for $11.00 seemed a little on the small side especially for the price but it was delectable. I got it cooked medium well and it was served in the right temperature for sure. I have to say that the fried mac and cheese patty was a little random and didn't even really need to be part of the burger. I was a little disappointed with that because I was actually really excited about it but for me it didn't add anything to the burger. My hubby just got a Basic burger and man oh man the prices can skyrocket when you start adding the toppings. The bacon add on was $2.00!!! That was just a little shocking to me, even though they were two big ass pieces of bacon.\n\nWe got large french fries for $4.00 with the sriracha mayo and honey mustard sauce. It's definitely big enough to split. I also recommend keeping the rooster sauce that came with the burger for dipping with the french fries, it's an awesome combo! Last but not least we got ice cream, cookies and cream and brownie chunk on a waffle bowl for $5.00. Both flavors were incredible!\n\nWe came on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy but we got great and pretty quick service. Our server was awesome, she was nice and present our whole meal, she definitely gave us a good dining experience. We will definitely be back and I am excited to try the other burgers!", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "Boogaloo was just firmly OK for me.  My mojito wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't the best one I'd ever had.  My paella wasn't terrible but it was also kind of bland and flavorless. And when you're at a cuban/cajun restaurant, I kind of expected a lot of flavor. Our crawfish cakes appetizer was good, flavorful and just enough for two people.  Our service was great though, very attentive and prompt.  My biggest complaint is the smoking section.  Half of the restaurant was empty but we had to wait for a table because we wanted non-smoking. Coming from Chicago where there's no smoking at all in restaurants, this is just a pain in the ass to wait for a table when there are tables simply because someone who smokes might want to sit there.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "I worked my way through college in restaurants.  I love eating out.  I love patios.  I love anti-pasto.  I love Tucson nights.  First time at Giuseppe's.\n\nOK, that being said, here goes:  Four of us at 7p on a Friday night, with a reservation.  One lonely, neglected-looking table on the patio - no silverware, etc.  We asked the hostess if we could sit there - sure!  No problem!  She took us to it right away - without wiping it down or setting it up.  That's cool, I'm happy we got a patio table.  A busboy shows up with silverware, but nothing to wipe the table off.  Off he goes.  Finally, we have the whole shebang - silverware, water, bread, etc.  Even menus!  So lucky!\n\nThen...waiting....waiting...waiting....no waiter, no waiter, no waiter.  Workers rushing to and fro, looking over at us, but unable to penentrate the invisible force field, I guess.  Finally, we get the waiter who's serving the adjacent table to acknowledge us and says he, \"I'm not your waiter, but I'll get him for you.\"  Gee!  Thanks, all-powerful keeper of the food.\n\nThen...waiter fight!  No one wants us!  Do we smell?  Don't think so - can't say for sure....the last thing, I, a survivor of my restaurant days, want to see when dining out is the internal politics of the restaurant played out in front of me.  I tip!  Maybe I should've made that clear upfront!\n\nOnce we got a waiter, things went better, albeit slowly.  We ordered an antipasto and stuffed mushrooms to start, with a couple of glasses of wine, which came lickity-split.  The anti-pasto is divine - all kinds of goodies you might find on a plate in Italy - prosciutto, salami, asparagus, olives, two kinds of cheese - little bites so tasty.  I will come back and have this as a meal.  The stuffed mushrooms are seafood-less - yay, me!  I hate fishy stuff.  Four to an order, nice for us.\n\nThe main courses were slow to follow.  We ordered some bolognese dishes and the shrimp special pasta of the evening.  The bolognese was OK - not the best and I agree with a previous reviewer that the meat was oddly over-cooked or something.  A little rubbery.  My fave in town is at Tavolino's, but they are so much more pricey...this dish is a lovely 9.95 and the pasta is light and the portion is big - so, it's easy to recommend.  The pasta special was also good with generous amounts of shrimp over fetuccine.\n\nNo dessert - tooooooo stuffed.  \n\nWe had a nice time because we were all too mellow to really care about being sadly neglected for FIFTEEN minutes at the beginning, but if any one of us had been bugged by it, it would have been a different story.  \n\nI highly recomment the anti-pasto, the mushrooms, the wine, the fresh pasta, but make sure to know who you waiter is supposed to be if you're sat at the lonely last table on the patio.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "This is such a great event!

They offer either egg white or regular eggs, and you can customize with veggies, cheese, and bacon or sausage. The sandwiches are all very filling and tasty. This is definitely not the healthiest option, but is a good treat.\n\nAlso, I frequent the location at 38th and walnut (on 38th).
